abstract = {The organization of episodes of activity and inactivity of Drosophila melanogaster has a complex structure. Episodes of apparently continuous activity have shorter episodes of inactivity embedded within them. This pattern of activity has a self-similar structure; the activity record appears the same regardless of the time scale used. There is a power law dependence of the rate ‘constants’ that describes how the activity of flies turns on and off. As a consequence no natural time scale for the measurement of the activity level exists, and the amount of activity depends on the time scale of measurement. The observation of fractal time variability in animal behaviour may illuminate the processes that produce activity. Fractal time variation in movement activity can lead to L\'{e}vy flight patterns of movement, which produce efficient searches.},

We describe "lethal tagging," a method used in conjunction with deficiency mapping for localizing major genes associated with quantitative traits. Rover/sitter is a naturally occurring larval foraging polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster which has a polygenic pattern of inheritance comprised of a single major gene (foraging) and minor modifier genes. We have successfully localized the lethal tagged foraging (for, 2-10) gene by deficiency mapping to 24A3-C5 on the polytene chromosome map.},

abstract = {In this study, we perform the first genetic analysis of K+ currents in Drosophila embryonic neurons revealing the identity of the currents present. Unlike muscles, where the presence of Shaker is obvious, Shaker currents are not detectable in these neurons. In contrast, we show that Shal is as important in these neuronal cell bodies as Shaker is in muscles. Only three single-channel currents were found, all of which are genetically separable. Shal encodes a 4 pS transient channel. Whole-cell Shal currents have a wide variety of inactivation rates which, in contrast to a mechanism such as heteromultimer formation, is due to single Shal channels assuming different gating modes. Shaw encodes a 42 pS noninactivating channel distinctive for its extremely low voltage sensitivity; Shaw channels have a total equivalent gating charge of 0.90 e- charges, in sharp contrast to 7 e- reported for Shaker channels. An 11 pS slowly inactivating channel also present in these neurons may be encoded by the Shab gene. Thus, of four voltage-dependent K+ channel genes now cloned in Drosophila, all except Shaker appear to be expressed in the cell bodies of these neurons. It is only in Drosophila that a study such as this one can be done. Because Drosophila contains only a single member of each of the four subfamilies of K+ channel genes (unlike mammals), we can eliminate an entire subfamily with a mutation to a single gene. Here, we have examined the effect of eliminating each of three subfamilies. Such a task is presently impossible to accomplish in any mammalian system.},

abstract = {At the Drosophila glutamatergic neuromuscular junction, the postsynaptic cell can regulate synaptic strength by both changing its sensitivity to neurotransmitter and generating a retrograde signal that regulates presynaptic transmitter release. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these forms of plasticity, we have undertaken a genetic analysis of two postsynaptic glutamate receptors that are expressed at this synapse. Deletion of both genes results in embryonic lethality that can be rescued by transgenic expression of either receptor. Although these receptors are redundant for viability, they have important differences. By transgenically rescuing the double mutant, we have investigated the relationship of receptor gene dosage and composition to synaptic function. We find that the receptor subunit composition regulates quantal size, Argiotoxin sensitivity, and receptor desensitization kinetics. Finally, we show that the activity of the receptor can regulate the retrograde signal functioning at this synapse. Thus, the diversity of receptors expressed at this synapse provides the cell with mechanisms for generating synaptic plasticity.},

@article{Ulens2001,
abstract = {An important step toward understanding the molecular basis of the functional diversity of pacemaker currents in spontaneously active cells has been the identification of a gene family encoding hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-sensitive cation nonselective (HCN) channels. Three of the four gene products that have been expressed so far give rise to pacemaker channels with distinct activation kinetics and are differentially distributed among the brain, with considerable overlap between some isoforms. This raises the possibility that HCN channels may coassemble to form heteromeric channels in some areas, similar to other K(+) channels. In this study, we have provided evidence for functional heteromerization of HCN1 and HCN2 channels using a concatenated cDNA construct encoding two connected subunits. We have observed that heteromeric channels activate several-fold faster than HCN2 and only a little slower than HCN1. Furthermore, the voltage dependence of activation is more similar to HCN2, whereas the cAMP sensitivity is intermediate between HCN1 and HCN2. This phenotype shows marked similarity to the current arising from coexpressed HCN1 and HCN2 subunits in oocytes and the native pacemaker current in CA1 pyramidal neurons. We suggest that heteromerization may increase the functional diversity beyond the levels expected from the number of HCN channel genes and their differential distribution.},

@article{Kim2007,
abstract = {Drosophila has robust behavioral plasticity to avoid or prefer the odor that predicts punishment or food reward, respectively. Both types of plasticity are mediated by the mushroom body (MB) neurons in the brain, in which various signaling molecules play crucial roles. However, important yet unresolved molecules are the receptors that initiate aversive or appetitive learning cascades in the MB. We have shown previously that D1 dopamine receptor dDA1 is highly enriched in the MB neuropil. Here, we demonstrate that dDA1 is a key receptor that mediates both aversive and appetitive learning in pavlovian olfactory conditioning. We identified two mutants, dumb1 and dumb2, with abnormal dDA1 expression. When trained with the same conditioned stimuli, both dumb alleles showed negligible learning in electric shock-mediated conditioning while they exhibited moderately impaired learning in sugar-mediated conditioning. These phenotypes were not attributable to anomalous sensory modalities of dumb mutants because their olfactory acuity, shock reactivity, and sugar preference were comparable to those of control lines. Remarkably, the dumb mutant's impaired performance in both paradigms was fully rescued by reinstating dDA1 expression in the same subset of MB neurons, indicating the critical roles of the MB dDA1 in aversive as well as appetitive learning. Previous studies using dopamine receptor antagonists implicate the involvement of D1/D5 receptors in various pavlovian conditioning tasks in mammals; however, these have not been supported by the studies of D1- or D5-deficient animals. The findings described here unambiguously clarify the critical roles of D1 dopamine receptor in aversive and appetitive pavlovian conditioning.},

abstract = {Behavior is a manifestation of temporally and spatially defined neuronal activities. To understand how behavior is controlled by the nervous system, it is important to identify the neuronal substrates responsible for these activities, and to elucidate how they are integrated into a functional circuit. I introduce a novel and general method to conditionally perturb anatomically defined neurons in intact Drosophila. In this method, a temperature-sensitive allele of shibire (shi(ts1)) is overexpressed in neuronal subsets using the GAL4/UAS system. Because the shi gene product is essential for synaptic vesicle recycling, and shi(ts1) is semidominant, a simple temperature shift should lead to fast and reversible effects on synaptic transmission of shi(ts1) expressing neurons. When shi(ts1) expression was directed to cholinergic neurons, adult flies showed a dramatic response to the restrictive temperature, becoming motionless within 2 min at 30 degrees C. This temperature-induced paralysis was reversible. After being shifted back to the permissive temperature, they readily regained their activity and started to walk in 1 min. When shi(ts1) was expressed in photoreceptor cells, adults and larvae exhibited temperature-dependent blindness. These observations show that the GAL4/UAS system can be used to express shi(ts1) in a specific subset of neurons to cause temperature-dependent changes in behavior. Because this method allows perturbation of the neuronal activities rapidly and reversibly in a spatially and temporally restricted manner, it will be useful to study the functional significance of particular neuronal subsets in the behavior of intact animals.},

abstract = {The healthy heartbeat is traditionally thought to be regulated according to the classical principle of homeostasis whereby physiologic systems operate to reduce variability and achieve an equilibrium-like state [Physiol. Rev. 9, 399-431 (1929)].  However, recent studies [Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 1343-1346 (1993); Fractals in Biology and Medicine (Birkhauser-Verlag, Basel, 1994), pp. 55-65] reveal that under normal conditions, beat-to-beat fluctuations in heart rate display the kind of long-range correlations typically exhibited by dynamical systems far from equilibrium [Phys. Rev. Lett. 59, 381-384 (1987)].  In contrast, heart rate time series from patients with severe congestive heart failure show a breakdown of this long-range correlation behavior.  We describe a new method--detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)--for quantifying this correlation property in non-stationary physiological time series.  Application of this technique shows evidence for a crossover phenomenon associated with a change in short and long-range scaling exponents.  This method may be of use in distinguishing healthy from pathologic data sets based on differences in these scaling properties.},

abstract = {During nervous system development, synapses undergo morphological change as a function of electrical activity. In Drosophila, enhanced activity results in the expansion of larval neuromuscular junctions. We have examined whether these structural changes involve the pre- or postsynaptic partner by selectively enhancing electrical excitability with a Shaker dominant-negative (SDN) potassium channel subunit. We find that the SDN enhances neurotransmitter release when expressed in motoneurons, postsynaptic potential broadening when expressed in muscles and neurons, and selectively suppresses fast-inactivating, Shaker-mediated IA currents in muscles. SDN expression also phenocopies the canonical behavioral phenotypes of the Sh mutation. At the neuromuscular junction, we find that activity-dependent changes in arbor size occur only when SDN is expressed presynaptically. This finding indicates that elevated postsynaptic membrane excitability is by itself insufficient to enhance presynaptic arbor growth. Such changes must minimally involve increased neuronal excitability.},

abstract = {In mammals, dopamine 2-like receptors are expressed in distinct pathways within the central nervous system, as well as in peripheral tissues. Selected neuronal D2-like receptors play a critical role in modulating locomotor activity and, as such, represent an important therapeutic target (e.g. in Parkinson's disease). Previous studies have established that proteins required for dopamine (DA) neurotransmission are highly conserved between mammals and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. These include a fly dopamine 2-like receptor (DD2R; Hearn et al. PNAS 2002 99(22):14554) that has structural and pharmacologic similarity to the human D2-like (D2R). In the current study, we define the spatial expression pattern of DD2R, and functionally characterize flies with reduced DD2 receptor levels. We show that DD2R is expressed in the larval and adult nervous systems, in cell groups that include the Ap-let cohort of peptidergic neurons, as well as in peripheral tissues including the gut and Malpighian tubules. To examine DD2R function in vivo, we generated RNA-interference (RNAi) flies with reduced DD2R expression. Behavioral analysis revealed that these flies show significantly decreased locomotor activity, similar to the phenotype observed in mammals with reduced D2R expression. The fly RNAi phenotype can be rescued by administration of the DD2R synthetic agonist bromocriptine, indicating specificity for the RNAi effect. These results suggest Drosophila as a useful system for future studies aimed at identifying modifiers of dopaminergic signaling/locomotor function.},

abstract = {In recent years, a number of tools have become available for remotely activating neural circuits in Drosophila. Despite widespread and growing use, very little work has been done to characterize exactly how these tools affect activity in identified fly neurons. Using the GAL4-UAS system, we expressed blue light-gated Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and a mutated form of ChR2 (H134R-ChR2) in motor and sensory neurons of the Drosophila third-instar locomotor circuit. Neurons expressing H134R-ChR2 show enhanced responses to blue light pulses and less spike frequency adaptation than neurons expressing ChR2. Although H134R-ChR2 was more effective at manipulating behavior than ChR2, the behavioral consequences of firing rate adaptation were different in sensory and motor neurons. For comparison, we examined the effects of ectopic expression of the warmth-activated cation channel Drosophila TRPA1 (dTRPA1). When dTRPA1 was expressed in larval motor neurons, heat ramps from 21 to 27 degrees C evoked tonic spiking at approximately 25 degrees C that showed little adaptation over many minutes. dTRPA1 activation had stronger and longer-lasting effects on behavior than ChR2 variants. These results suggest that dTRPA1 may be particularly useful for researchers interested in activating fly neural circuits over long time scales. Overall, this work suggests that understanding the cellular effects of these genetic tools and their temporal dynamics is important for the design and interpretation of behavioral experiments.},

Several types of CX neuron have been identified but it is not known if these exist singly or as components of isomorphic sets. We used an enhancer trap approach to study the adult structure, connectivity, and polarity of CX neurons in Drosophila. We observed several isomorphic sets of small-field neurons including pontine and fb-eb neurons, and also isomorphic sets of large-field neurons including R neurons and F neurons. We found that several types of large-field F neurons existed in isomorphic sets of approximately eight (four per hemisphere) and found evidence for small-field neuron types existing as isomorphic sets of 16. Small-field neurons were observed in clearly organized layers. This study provides a novel insight into CX structure and connectivity and provides a set of characterized enhancer trap lines that will be valuable for future study.},

abstract = {Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels comprise a small subfamily of proteins within the superfamily of pore-loop cation channels. In mammals, the HCN channel family comprises four members (HCN1-4) that are expressed in heart and nervous system. The current produced by HCN channels has been known as I(h) (or I(f) or I(q)). I(h) has also been designated as pacemaker current, because it plays a key role in controlling rhythmic activity of cardiac pacemaker cells and spontaneously firing neurons. Extensive studies over the last decade have provided convincing evidence that I(h) is also involved in a number of basic physiological processes that are not directly associated with rhythmicity. Examples for these non-pacemaking functions of I(h) are the determination of the resting membrane potential, dendritic integration, synaptic transmission, and learning. In this review we summarize recent insights into the structure, function, and cellular regulation of HCN channels. We also discuss in detail the different aspects of HCN channel physiology in the heart and nervous system. To this end, evidence on the role of individual HCN channel types arising from the analysis of HCN knockout mouse models is discussed. Finally, we provide an overview of the impact of HCN channels on the pathogenesis of several diseases and discuss recent attempts to establish HCN channels as drug targets.},

abstract = {The physiological function of dopamine is mediated through its G-protein-coupled receptor family. In Drosophila, four dopamine receptors have been molecularly characterized so far. However, due largely to the absence of a suitable preparation, the role of Drosophila dopamine receptors in modulating central synaptic transmission has not been examined. The present study investigated mechanisms by which dopamine modulates excitatory cholinergic synaptic transmission in Drosophila using primary neuronal cultures. Whole-cell recordings demonstrated that cholinergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were down-regulated by focally applied dopamine (10-500 microm). The vertebrate D1 specific agonists SKF38393 and 6-chloro-APB (10 microm) mimicked dopamine-mediated suppression of cholinergic synaptic transmission with higher potency. In contrast, the D2 agonists quinpirole and bromocriptine did not alter cholinergic EPSCs, demonstrating that dopamine-mediated suppression of cholinergic synaptic transmission is specifically through activation of Drosophila D1-like receptors. Biophysical analysis of miniature EPSCs indicated that cholinergic suppression by activation of D1-like receptors is presynaptic in origin. Dopamine modulation of cholinergic transmission is not mediated through the cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway as cholinergic suppression by dopamine occurred in the presence of the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89. In addition, an adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, led to an increase, not a decrease, of cholinergic EPSC frequency. Finally, we showed that activation of D1-like receptors decreased the frequency of action potentials in cultured Drosophila neurons by inhibiting excitatory cholinergic transmission. All our data demonstrated that activation of D1-like receptors in Drosophila neurons negatively modulates excitatory cholinergic synaptic transmission and thus inhibits neuronal excitability.},

abstract = {Presynaptic activation of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent generation of cAMP represent an important mechanism in the modulation of synaptic transmission. In many cases, short- to medium-term modulation of synaptic strength by cAMP is due to activation of protein kinase A and subsequent covalent modification of presynaptic ion channels or synaptic proteins. Here we show that presynaptic cAMP generation via serotonin receptor activation directly modulated hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (Ih channels) in axons. This modulation of Ih produced an increase in synaptic strength that could not be explained solely by depolarization of the presynaptic membrane. These studies identify a mechanism by which cAMP and Ih regulate synaptic plasticity.},

Allelic variation causes alternative behavioral phenotypes, whereas changes in gene expression can influence the initiation of behavior at different ages. We show that the age-related transition by honey bees from hive work to foraging is associated with an increase in the expression of the foraging (for) gene, which encodes a guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKG). cGMP treatment elevated PKG activity and caused foraging behavior. Previous research showed that allelic differences in PKG expression result in two Drosophila foraging variants. The same gene can thus exert different types of influence on a behavior.},

abstract = {The world is permanently changing. Laboratory experiments on learning and memory normally minimize this feature of reality, keeping all conditions except the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli as constant as possible. In the real world, however, animals need to extract from the universe of sensory signals the actual predictors of salient events by separating them from non-predictive stimuli (context). In principle, this can be achieved if only those sensory inputs that resemble the reinforcer in their temporal structure are taken as predictors. Here we study visual learning in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, using a flight simulator, and show that memory retrieval is, indeed, partially context-independent. Moreover, we show that the mushroom bodies, which are required for olfactory but not visual or tactile learning, effectively support context generalization. In visual learning in Drosophila, it appears that a facilitating effect of context cues for memory retrieval is the default state, whereas making recall context-independent requires additional processing.},

We focus on two quantities for each user: the time interval between consecutively sent e-mails (interevent time), and the time interval between when a user sends an e-mail and when a recipient sends an e-mail back to the original sender (waiting time). We perform a standard Bayesian model selection analysis that demonstrates that the interevent times are well-described by a single log-normal while the waiting times are better described by the superposition of two log-normals. Our analysis rejects the possibility that either measure could be described by truncated power-law distributions with exponent \$\backslash alpha \backslash simeq 1\$. We also critically evaluate the priority queuing model proposed by Barab$\backslash$'asi to describe the distribution of the waiting times. We show that neither the assumptions nor the predictions of the model are plausible, and conclude that a theoretical description of human e-mail communication patterns remains an open problem.},

abstract = {Members of the HCN channel family generate hyperpolarization-activated cation currents (Ih) that are directly regulated by cAMP and contribute to pacemaker activity in heart and brain. The four HCN isoforms show distinct but overlapping patterns of expression in different tissues. Here, we report that HCN1 and HCN2, isoforms coexpressed in neocortex and hippocampus that differ markedly in their biophysical properties, coassemble to generate heteromultimeric channels with novel properties. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, HCN1 channels activate 5-10-fold more rapidly than HCN2 channels. HCN1 channels also activate at voltages that are 10-20 mV more positive than those required to activate HCN2. In cell-free patches, the steady-state activation curve of HCN1 channels shows a minimal shift in response to cAMP (+4 mV), whereas that of HCN2 channels shows a pronounced shift (+17 mV). Coexpression of HCN1 and HCN2 yields Ih currents that activate with kinetics and a voltage dependence that tend to be intermediate between those of HCN1 and HCN2 homomers, although the coexpressed channels do show a relatively large shift by cAMP (+14 mV). Neither the kinetics, steady-state voltage dependence, nor cAMP dose-response curve for the coexpressed Ih can be reproduced by the linear sum of independent populations of HCN1 and HCN2 homomers. These results are most simply explained by the formation of heteromeric channels with novel properties. The properties of these heteromeric channels closely resemble the properties of I(h) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, cells that coexpress HCN1 and HCN2. Finally, differences in Ih channel properties recorded in cell-free patches versus intact oocytes are shown to be due, in part, to modulation of Ih by basal levels of cAMP in intact cells.},

To assess the influence of the mushroom bodies on walking activity, three independent noninvasive methods interfering with mushroom body function are applied: chemical ablation of the mushroom body precursor cells; a mutant affecting Kenyon cell differentiation (mushroom body miniature1); and the targeted expression of the catalytic subunit of tetanus toxin in subsets of Kenyon cells. All groups of flies with mushroom body defects show an elevated level of total walking activity. This increase is attributable to the slower and less complete attenuation of activity during the experiment. Walking activity in normal and mushroom body-deficient flies is clustered in active phases (bouts) and rest periods (pauses). Neither the initiation nor the internal structure, but solely the termination of bouts seems to be affected by the mushroom body defects. How this finding relates to the well-documented role of the mushroom bodies in olfactory learning and memory remains to be understood.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In vertebrates, Ran-Binding Protein in the Microtubule Organizing Center (RanBPM) appears to function as a scaffolding protein in a variety of signal transduction pathways. In Drosophila, RanBPM is implicated in the regulation of germ line stem cell (GSC) niche organization in the ovary. Here, we addressed the role of RanBPM in nervous system function in the context of Drosophila larval behavior. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report that in Drosophila, RanBPM is required for larval feeding, light-induced changes in locomotion, and viability. RanBPM is highly expressed in the Kenyon cells of the larval mushroom body (MB), a structure well studied for its role in associative learning in Drosophila and other insects. RanBPM mutants do not display major disruption in nervous system morphology besides reduced proliferation. Expression of the RanBPM gene in the Kenyon cells is sufficient to rescue all behavioral phenotypes. Through genetic epistasis experiments, we demonstrate that RanBPM participates with the Drosophila orthologue of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) in the development of neuromuscular junction (NMJ). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that the RanBPM gene functions in the MB neurons for larval behavior. Our results suggest a role for this gene in an FMRP-dependent process. Taken together our findings point to a novel role for the MB in larval behavior.},

We suggest that the strong UV component of sunlight contributed to the selective pressure for the evolution of the specialized photoreceptor cryptochrome from photolyases involved in DNA repair and propose that early metazoans avoided irradiation by descending in the oceans during the daytime. We suggest further that it is not coincidental that blue-light photoreception evolved in an aquatic environment, since only blue light can penetrate to substantial depths in water. These photoreceptors were then also critical for sensing the decreased luminescence that signals the coming of night and the time to return to the surface. The oceans and the 24-h light-dark cycle therefore provided an optimal setting for an early evolutionary relationship between blue-light photoreception and circadian rhythmicity.},

abstract = {Dopamine is an important neuromodulator in animals and its roles in mammalian sexual behavior are extensively studied. Drosophila as a useful model system is widely used in many fields of biological studies. It has been reported that dopamine reduction can affect female receptivity in Drosophila and leave male-female courtship behavior unaffected. Here, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to decrease the dopamine level in dopaminergic cells in Drosophila, and investigated the consequence of this manipulation on male homosexual courtship behavior. We find that reduction of dopamine level can induce Drosophila male-male courtship behavior, and that this behavior is mainly due to the increased male attractiveness or decreased aversiveness towards other males, but not to their enhanced propensity to court other males. Chemical signal input probably plays a crucial role in the male-male courtship induced by the courtees with reduction of dopamine. Our finding provides insight into the relationship between the dopamine reduction and male-male courtship behavior, and hints dopamine level is important for controlling Drosophila courtship behavior.},

abstract = {Environmental and genetic factors can modulate aggressiveness, but the biological mechanisms underlying their influence are largely unknown. Social experience with conspecifics suppresses aggressiveness in both vertebrate and invertebrate species, including Drosophila. We searched for genes whose expression levels correlate with the influence of social experience on aggressiveness in Drosophila by performing microarray analysis of head tissue from socially isolated (aggressive) vs. socially experienced (nonaggressive) male flies. Among approximately 200 differentially expressed genes, only one was also present in a gene set previously identified by profiling Drosophila strains subjected to genetic selection for differences in aggressiveness [Dierick HA, Greenspan RJ (2006) Nat Genet 38:1023-1031]. This gene, Cyp6a20, encodes a cytochrome P450. Social experience increased Cyp6a20 expression and decreased aggressiveness in a reversible manner. In Cyp6a20 mutants, aggressiveness was increased in group-housed but not socially isolated flies. These data identify a common genetic target for environmental and heritable influences on aggressiveness. Cyp6a20 is expressed in a subset of nonneuronal support cells associated with pheromone-sensing olfactory sensilla, suggesting that social experience may influence aggressiveness by regulating pheromone sensitivity.},

As seen, for example, during waking compared with being asleep or under anesthesia, neuronal responsiveness differs, concomitant with the pattern of spontaneous brain activity. This pattern, which defines the state of the network, has a dramatic influence on how local networks are engaged by inputs and, therefore, on how information is represented. We review here experimental and theoretical evidence of the decisive role played by stochastic network states in sensory responsiveness with emphasis on activated states such as waking. From single cells to networks, experiments and computational models have addressed the relation between neuronal responsiveness and the complex spatiotemporal patterns of network activity. The understanding of the relation between network state dynamics and information representation is a major challenge that will require developing, in conjunction, specific experimental paradigms and theoretical frameworks.},

abstract = {Background: Video cameras sense passively from a distance, offer a rich information stream, and provide intuitively meaningful raw data. Camera-based imaging has thus proven critical for many advances in neuroscience and biology, with applications ranging from cellular imaging of fluorescent dyes to tracking of whole-animal behavior at ecologically relevant spatial scales. Results: Here we present 'Motmot': an open-source software suite for acquiring, displaying, saving, and analyzing digital video in real-time. At the highest level, Motmot is written in the Python computer language. The large amounts of data produced by digital cameras are handled by low-level, optimized functions, usually written in C. This high-level/low-level partitioning and use of select external libraries allow Motmot, with only modest complexity, to perform well as a core technology for many high-performance imaging tasks. In its current form, Motmot allows for: (1) image acquisition from a variety of camera interfaces (package motmot.cam\_iface), (2) the display of these images with minimal latency and computer resources using wxPython and OpenGL (package motmot.wxglvideo), (3) saving images with no compression in a single-pass, low-CPU-use format (package motmot.FlyMovieFormat), (4) a pluggable framework for custom analysis of images in realtime and (5) firmware for an inexpensive USB device to synchronize image acquisition across multiple cameras, with analog input, or with other hardware devices (package motmot.fview\_ext\_trig). These capabilities are brought together in a graphical user interface, called 'FView', allowing an end user to easily view and save digital video without writing any code. One plugin for FView, 'FlyTrax', which tracks the movement of fruit flies in real-time, is included with Motmot, and is described to illustrate the capabilities of FView. Conclusion: Motmot enables realtime image processing and display using the Python computer language. In addition to the provided complete applications, the architecture allows the user to write relatively simple plugins, which can accomplish a variety of computer vision tasks and be integrated within larger software systems.

abstract = {Activins are members of the TGF-?? superfamily of secreted growth factors that control a diverse array of processes in vertebrates including endocrine function, cell proliferation, differentiation, immune response and wound repair. In Drosophila, the Activin ligand Dawdle (Daw) has been shown to regulate several aspects of neuronal development such as embryonic axonal pathfinding, neuroblast proliferation in the larval brain and growth cone motility in the visual system. Here we identify a novel role for Activin signaling in regulating synaptic growth at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Mutants for Daw, the Activin type I receptor Baboon (Babo), and the signal transducer dSmad2, display reduced NMJ size suggesting that Daw utilizes a canonical Activin signal-transduction pathway in this context. Additionally, loss of Daw/Babo activity affects microtubule stability, axonal transport and distribution of Futsch, the Drosophila microtubule associated protein 1B (MAP1B) homolog. We find that Babo signaling is required postsynaptically in the muscle, in contrast to the well-characterized retrograde BMP/Gbb signal that is required for synaptic growth and function in presynaptic cells. Finally, we show that the Daw/Babo pathway acts upstream of gbb, and is involved in maintenance of muscle gbb expression, suggesting that Activins regulate NMJ growth by modulating BMP activity through transcriptional regulation of ligand expression. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The temporal pairing of a neutral stimulus with a reinforcer (reward or punishment) can lead to classical conditioning, a simple form of learning in which the animal assigns a value (positive or negative) to the formerly neutral stimulus [1]. Olfactory classical conditioning in Drosophila is a prime model for the analysis of the molecular and neuronal substrate of this type of learning and memory [2-5]. Neuronal correlates of associative plasticity have been identified in several regions of the insect brain. In particular, the mushroom bodies have been shown to be necessary for aversive olfactory memory formation [6]. However, little is known about which neurons mediate the reinforcing stimulus. Using functional optical imaging, we now show that dopaminergic projections to the mushroom-body lobes are weakly activated by odor stimuli but respond strongly to electric shocks. However, after one of two odors is paired several times with an electric shock, odor-evoked activity is significantly prolonged only for the "punished" odor. Whereas dopaminergic neurons mediate rewarding reinforcement in mammals [7], our data suggest a role for aversive reinforcement in Drosophila. However, the dopaminergic neurons' capability of mediating and predicting a reinforcing stimulus appears to be conserved between Drosophila and mammals. ©2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent studies using functional optical imaging have revealed that cellular memory traces form in different areas of the insect brain after olfactory classical conditioning. These traces are revealed as increased calcium signals or synaptic release from defined neurons, and include a short-lived trace that forms immediately after conditioning in antennal lobe projection neurons, an early trace in dopaminergic neurons, and a medium-term trace in dorsal paired medial neurons. New molecular genetic tools have revealed that for normal behavioral memory performance, synaptic transmission from the mushroom body neurons is required only during retrieval, whereas synaptic transmission from dopaminergic neurons is required at the time of acquisition and synaptic transmission from dorsal paired medial neurons is required during the consolidation period. Such experimental results are helping to identify the types of neurons that participate in olfactory learning and when their participation is required. Olfactory learning often occurs alongside crossmodal interactions of sensory information from other modalities. Recent studies have revealed complex interactions between the olfactory and the visual senses that can occur during olfactory learning, including the facilitation of learning about subthreshold olfactory stimuli due to training with concurrent visual stimuli. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Incorporation of circularly permuted Venus in place of Citrine results in a 3- to 5-fold increase in the dynamic range.

Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. In contrast, there is increasing evidence that the timing of many human activities, ranging from communication to entertainment and work patterns, follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. Here I show that the bursty nature of human behaviour is a consequence of a decision-based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, with most tasks being rapidly executed, whereas a few experience very long waiting times. In contrast, random or priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform inter-event statistics. These finding have important implications, ranging from resource management to service allocation, in both communications and retail.},

We have previously shown that mutations in scribbler (sbb), a gene encoding two transcripts widely expressed in the nervous system, cause abnormally frequent episodes of turning in the third instar larva. Here we report that hypomorphic sbb mutant larvae display aberrant turning from the second instar stage onwards. We focus on the smaller of the two sbb transcripts and show that its pan-neural expression during early larval life, but not in later larval life, restores wild type turning behavior. To identify the classes of neurons in which this sbb transcript is involved, we carried out transgenic rescue experiments. Targeted expression of the small sbb transcript using the cha-GAL4 driver was sufficient to restore wild type turning behavior. In contrast, expression of this sbb transcript in motoneurons, sensory neurons or large numbers of unidentified interneurons was not sufficient. Our data suggest that the expression of the smaller sbb transcript may be needed in a subset of neurons for the maintenance of normal turning behavior in Drosophila larvae.},

abstract = {A great challenge facing neuroscience is to understand how genes, molecules, cells, circuits, and systems interact to generate social behavior. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) offer a powerful model system to address questions of this magnitude. These animals display genetically specified, sexually dimorphic patterns of fighting behavior via sex-specific splicing of the fruitless gene. Here, we show that sexually dimorphic behavioral patterns displayed during aggression are controlled by specific subgroups of neurons expressing male forms of fruitless proteins (Fru(M)). Using the GAL4/UAS system to manipulate transformer expression, we feminized or masculinized different populations of neurons in fly nervous systems. With a panneuronal elav-GAL4 driver, male patterns of fighting behavior were transferred into females and female patterns into males. We screened 60 Gal4 lines that express the yeast transcription factor in different patterns in fly central nervous systems and found five that showed abnormal same-sex courtship behavior. The sexually dimorphic fighting patterns, however, were completely switched only in one and partially switched in a second of these lines. In the other three lines, female patterns of aggression were seen despite a switch in courtship preference. A tight correspondence was seen between Fru(M) expression and how flies fight in several subgroups of neurons usually expressing these proteins: Expression is absent when flies fight like females and present when flies fight like males, thereby beginning a separation between courtship and aggression among these neurons.},

Each substructure contains repeated neuronal elements which are connected by processes such that topography is maintained. Although the neuronal architecture has been described in several insects and the behavioral role investigated in various experiments, the exact function of this neuropil has proven elusive. To describe the architecture of the central complex, we study 15 enhancer-trap lines that label various ellipsoid body neuron types. We find evidence for restriction of gene expression that is correlated with specific neuronal types: such correlations suggest functional classifications as well. We show that some enhancer-trap patterns reveal a single ellipsoid body neuron type, while others label multiple types. We describe the development of the ellipsoid body neuropil in wild-type animals and propose developmental mechanisms based on animals displaying structural mutations of this neuropil. The experiments performed here demonstrate the degree of resolution possible from the analysis of enhancer-trap lines and form a useful library of tools for future structure/function studies of the ellipsoid body.},

However, the precise in vivo roles of Neuroligins remain unclear. In the present study, we have analyzed the function of Drosophila neuroligin 2 (dnl2) in synaptic development and function. We show that dnl2 is strongly expressed in the embryonic and larval CNS and at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). dnl2 null mutants are viable but display numerous structural defects at the NMJ, including reduced axonal branching and fewer synaptic boutons. dnl2 mutants also show an increase in the number of active zones per bouton but a decrease in the thickness of the subsynaptic reticulum and length of postsynaptic densities. dnl2 mutants also exhibit a decrease in the total glutamate receptor density and a shift in the subunit composition of glutamate receptors in favor of GluRIIA complexes. In addition to the observed defects in synaptic morphology, we also find that dnl2 mutants show increased transmitter release and altered kinetics of stimulus-evoked transmitter release. Importantly, the defects in presynaptic structure, receptor density, and synaptic transmission can be rescued by postsynaptic expression of dnl2. Finally, we show that dnl2 colocalizes and binds to Drosophila neurexin (dnrx) in vivo. However, whereas homozygous mutants for either dnl2 or dnrx are viable, double mutants are lethal and display more severe defects in synaptic morphology. Altogether, our data show that, although dnl2 is not absolutely required for synaptogenesis, it is required postsynaptically for synapse maturation and function.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated as an important trigger for Parkinson's disease-like pathogenesis because exposure to environmental mitochondrial toxins leads to Parkinson's disease-like pathology. Recently, multiple genes mediating familial forms of Parkinson's disease have been identified, including PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1; PARK6) and parkin (PARK2), which are also associated with sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease. PINK1 encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase with a mitochondrial targeting sequence. So far, no in vivo studies have been reported for pink1 in any model system. Here we show that removal of Drosophila PINK1 homologue (CG4523; hereafter called pink1) function results in male sterility, apoptotic muscle degeneration, defects in mitochondrial morphology and increased sensitivity to multiple stresses including oxidative stress. Pink1 localizes to mitochondria, and mitochondrial cristae are fragmented in pink1 mutants. Expression of human PINK1 in the Drosophila testes restores male fertility and normal mitochondrial morphology in a portion of pink1 mutants, demonstrating functional conservation between human and Drosophila Pink1. Loss of Drosophila parkin shows phenotypes similar to loss of pink1 function. Notably, overexpression of parkin rescues the male sterility and mitochondrial morphology defects of pink1 mutants, whereas double mutants removing both pink1 and parkin function show muscle phenotypes identical to those observed in either mutant alone. These observations suggest that pink1 and parkin function, at least in part, in the same pathway, with pink1 functioning upstream of parkin. The role of the pink1-parkin pathway in regulating mitochondrial function underscores the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction as a central mechanism of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.},

We link natural variation in the thermotolerance of neural function and behavior in Drosophila melanogaster to the foraging gene (for, which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG)) as well as to its downstream target, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Genetic and pharmacological manipulations revealed that reduced PKG (or PP2A) activity caused increased thermotolerance of synaptic transmission at the larval neuromuscular junction. Like synaptic transmission, feeding movements were preserved at higher temperatures in larvae with lower PKG levels. In a comparative assay, pharmacological manipulations altering thermotolerance in a central circuit of Locusta migratoria demonstrated conservation of this neuroprotective pathway. In this circuit, either the inhibition of PKG or PP2A induced robust thermotolerance of neural function. We suggest that PKG and therefore the polymorphism associated with the allelic variation in for may provide populations with natural variation in heat stress tolerance. for's function in behavior is conserved across most organisms, including ants, bees, nematodes, and mammals. PKG's role in thermotolerance may also apply to these and other species. Natural variation in thermotolerance arising from genes involved in the PKG pathway could impact the evolution of thermotolerance in natural populations.},

The identity, kinetics and location of the vesicle pools that are mobilized by neuronal activity have been studied using a variety of techniques. We created a genetically encoded probe, biosyn, which consists of a biotinylated VAMP2 expressed at presynaptic terminals. We exploited the high-affinity interaction between streptavidin and biotin to label biosyn with fluorescent streptavidin during vesicle fusion. This approach allowed us to tag vesicles sequentially to visualize and establish the identity of presynaptic pools. Using this technique, we were able to distinguish between two different pools of vesicles in rat hippocampal neurons: one that was released in response to presynaptic activity and another, distinct vesicle pool that spontaneously fused with the plasma membrane. We found that the spontaneous vesicles belonged to a 'resting pool' that is normally not mobilized by neuronal activity and whose function was previously unknown.},

The interactions inter se of this set of genes were then assayed in the presence and in the absence of the original Syntaxin1A mutation to ask whether the relationships among the 16 genes remain stable or differ after a change in genetic context. The pattern of epistatic interactions that occurs within this set of variants is dramatically altered in the two different genetic contexts.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Zipf's discovery that word frequency distributions obey a power law established parallels between biological and physical processes, and language, laying the groundwork for a complex systems perspective on human communication. More recent research has also identified scaling regularities in the dynamics underlying the successive occurrences of events, suggesting the possibility of similar findings for language as well. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By considering frequent words in USENET discussion groups and in disparate databases where the language has different levels of formality, here we show that the distributions of distances between successive occurrences of the same word display bursty deviations from a Poisson process and are well characterized by a stretched exponential (Weibull) scaling. The extent of this deviation depends strongly on semantic type -- a measure of the logicality of each word -- and less strongly on frequency. We develop a generative model of this behavior that fully determines the dynamics of word usage. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Recurrence patterns of words are well described by a stretched exponential distribution of recurrence times, an empirical scaling that cannot be anticipated from Zipf's law. Because the use of words provides a uniquely precise and powerful lens on human thought and activity, our findings also have implications for other overt manifestations of collective human dynamics.},

abstract = {I(f), a diastolic depolarizing current activated by hyperpolarization, is a key player in cardiac pacing. Despite the fact that I(f) has been known for over 20 years, the encoding genes, namely HCN1 to 4, have only recently been identified. Functional data imply that different HCN isoforms may coassemble to form heteromeric channel complexes, but little direct evidence is available. Subunit stoichiometry is also unknown. Although the pore region of HCN channels contains the glycine-tyrosine-glycine (GYG) signature motif found in K+-selective channels, they permeate both Na+ and K+. In the present study, we probed the functional importance of the GYG selectivity motif in pacemaker channels by replacing this triplet in HCN1 with alanines (GYG(349-351)AAA or HCN1-AAA). HCN1-AAA did not yield functional currents; coexpression of HCN1-AAA with wild-type (WT) HCN1 suppressed normal channel activity in a dominant-negative manner (55.2+/-3.2\%, 68.3+/-4.3\%, 78.7+/-1.6\%, 91.7+/-0.8\%, and 97.9+/-0.2\% current reduction at -140 mV for WT:AAA cRNA ratios of 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2, respectively) without affecting gating (steady-state activation, activation and deactivation kinetics) or permeation (reversal potential) properties. HCN1-AAA coexpression, however, did not alter the expressed current amplitudes of Kv1.4 and Kv2.1 channels, indicating that its suppressive effect was channel-specific. Statistical analysis reveals that a single HCN channel is composed of 4 monomeric subunits. Interestingly, HCN1-AAA also inhibited HCN2 in a dominant-negative manner with the same efficacy. We conclude that the GYG motif is a critical determinant of ion permeation for HCN channels, and that HCN1 and HCN2 readily coassemble to form heterotetrameric complexes.},

abstract = {Background: Although sleep is an important process essential for life, its regulation is poorly understood. The recently developed Drosophila model for sleep provides a powerful system to genetically and pharmacologically identify molecules that regulate sleep. Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter known to affect many behaviors, but its role in sleep remains controversial. Results: We generated or obtained flies with genetically altered expression of each of three Drosophila serotonin receptor subtypes (d5-HT1A, d5-HT1B, and d5-HT2) and assayed them for baseline sleep phenotypes. The data indicated a sleep-regulating role for the d5-HT1A receptor. d5-HT1A mutant flies had short and fragmented sleep, which was rescued by expressing the receptor in adult mushroom bodies, a structure associated with learning and memory in Drosophila. Neither the d5-HT2 receptor nor the d5-HT1B receptor, which was previously implicated in circadian regulation, had any effect on baseline sleep, indicating that serotonin affects sleep and circadian rhythms through distinct receptors. Elevating serotonin levels, either pharmacologically or genetically, enhanced sleep in wild-type flies. In addition, serotonin promoted sleep in some short-sleep mutants, suggesting that it can compensate for some sleep deficits. Conclusions: These data show that serotonin promotes baseline sleep in Drosophila. They also link the regulation of sleep behavior by serotonin to a specific receptor in a distinct region of the fly brain. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Although REM sleep was discovered more than 50 years ago, the neuronal circuits responsible for switching between REM and non-REM (NREM) sleep remain poorly understood. Here we propose a brainstem flip-flop switch, consisting of mutually inhibitory REM-off and REM-on areas in the mesopontine tegmentum. Each side contains GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-ergic neurons that heavily innervate the other. The REM-on area also contains two populations of glutamatergic neurons. One set projects to the basal forebrain and regulates EEG components of REM sleep, whereas the other projects to the medulla and spinal cord and regulates atonia during REM sleep. The mutually inhibitory interactions of the REM-on and REM-off areas may form a flip-flop switch that sharpens state transitions and makes them vulnerable to sudden, unwanted transitions-for example, in narcolepsy.},

abstract = {Drosophila larvae and adults exhibit a naturally occurring genetically based behavioural polymorphism in locomotor activity while foraging. Larvae of the rover morph exhibit longer foraging trails than sitters and forage between food patches, while sitters have shorter foraging trails and forage within patches. This behaviour is influenced by levels of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PGK) encoded by the foraging (for) gene. Rover larvae have higher expression levels and higher PGK activities than do sitters. Here we discuss the importance of the for gene for studies of the mechanistic and evolutionary significance of individual differences in behaviour. We also show how structure-function analysis can be used to investigate a role for mushroom bodies in larval behaviour both in the presence and in the absence of food. Hydroxyurea fed to newly hatched larvae prevents the development of all post-embryonically derived mushroom body (MB) neuropil. This method was used to ablate MBs in rover and sitter genetic variants of foraging to test whether these structures mediate expression of the foraging behavioural polymorphism. We found that locomotor activity levels during foraging of both the rover and sitter larval morphs were not significantly influenced by MB ablation. Alternative hypotheses that may explain how variation in foraging behaviour is generated are discussed.},

abstract = {Both serotonin (5-HT) and neuropeptide Y have been shown to affect a variety of mammalian behaviors, including aggression. Here we show in Drosophila melanogaster that both 5-HT and neuropeptide F, the invertebrate homolog of neuropeptide Y, modulate aggression. We show that drug-induced increases of 5-HT in the fly brain increase aggression. Elevating 5-HT genetically in the serotonergic circuits recapitulates these pharmacological effects, whereas genetic silencing of these circuits makes the flies behaviorally unresponsive to the drug-induced increase of 5-HT but leaves them capable of aggression. Genetic silencing of the neuropeptide F (npf) circuit also increases fly aggression, demonstrating an opposite modulation to 5-HT. Moreover, this neuropeptide F effect seems to be independent of 5-HT. The implication of these two modulatory systems in fly and mouse aggression suggest a marked degree of conservation and a deep molecular root for this behavior.},

abstract = {The dynamics of many social, technological and economic phenomena are driven by individual human actions, turning the quantitative understanding of human behaviour into a central question of modern science. Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. In contrast, there is increasing evidence that the timing of many human activities, ranging from communication to entertainment and work patterns, follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. Here I show that the bursty nature of human behaviour is a consequence of a decision-based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, with most tasks being rapidly executed, whereas a few experience very long waiting times. In contrast, random or priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform inter-event statistics. These finding have important implications, ranging from resource management to service allocation, in both communications and retail.},

abstract = {Complex behaviors, such as aggression, are comprised of distinct stereospecific behavioral patterns (modules). How such patterns get wired into nervous systems remains unknown. Recently, we reported on a quantitative analysis of fighting behavior in male flies of the common Canton-S strain of Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we report a similar analysis of fighting behavior in females of the same species. Fights were carried out between pairs of virgin and pairs of mated females in competition for a yeast resource. Each fight was videotaped and analyzed by using transition matrices and Markov chain analyses. We observe only small difference in fighting intensity between virgin and mated females. In contrast to what is seen in male fights, however, no clear hierarchical relationship is formed in the female fights. A further comparison of the behavioral patterns making up male and female fights reveals that some modules are shared by both sexes, whereas others are highly selective. Within the shared components, transitions between the modules also show gender-selective differences. By using the powerful genetic methods available for examining behavior in fruit flies, it should be possible to use the gender-selective differences in fighting behavior to address the question of how these behavioral patterns get established in the brains of fruit flies.},

Here, we characterized sleep in 40 wild-derived Drosophila lines and observed abundant genetic variation in sleep architecture. We associated sleep with genome-wide variation in gene expression to identify candidate genes. We independently confirmed that molecular polymorphisms in Catsup (Catecholamines up) are associated with variation in sleep and that P-element mutations in four candidate genes affect sleep and gene expression. Transcripts associated with sleep grouped into biologically plausible genetically correlated transcriptional modules. We confirmed co-regulated gene expression using P-element mutants. Quantitative genetic analysis of natural phenotypic variation is an efficient method for revealing candidate genes and pathways.},

abstract = {DURING SHORT BURSTS OF NEURONAL ACTIVITY, CHANGES IN THE EFFICACY OF NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE ARE GOVERNED PRIMARILY BY TWO COUNTERACTING PROCESSES: (1) Ca(2+)-dependent elevations of vesicle release probability and (2) depletion of synaptic vesicles. The dynamic interplay of both processes contributes to the expression of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Here, we exploited various facets of short-term plasticity at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction to dissect these two processes. This enabled us to rigorously analyze different models of synaptic vesicle pools in terms of their size and mobilization properties. Independent of the specific model, we estimate approximately 300 readily releasable vesicles with an average release probability of approximately 50\% in 1 mM extracellular calcium ( approximately 5\% in 0.4 mM extracellular calcium) under resting conditions. The models also helped interpreting the altered short-term plasticity of the previously reported mutant of the active zone component Bruchpilot (BRP). Finally, our results were independently confirmed through fluctuation analysis. Our data reveal that the altered short-term plasticity observed in BRP mutants cannot be accounted for by delocalized Ca(2+) channels alone and thus suggest an additional role of BRP in short-term plasticity.},

abstract = {Dopamine is found in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues in the larval stage of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and functions as a signaling molecule in the nervous system. Although dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) were previously thought solely to be interneurons, recent studies suggest that dopamine may also act as a neuromodulator in humoral pathways. We examined both application of dopamine on intact larval CNS-segmental preparations and isolated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Dopamine rapidly decreased the rhythmicity of the CNS motor activity. Application of dopamine on neuromuscular preparations of the segmental muscles 6 and 7 resulted in a dose-responsive decrease in the excitatory junction potentials (EJPs). With the use of focal, macro-patch synaptic current recordings the quantal evoked transmission showed a depression of vesicular release at concentrations of 10 microM. Higher concentrations (1 mM) produced a rapid decrement in evoked vesicular release. Dopamine did not alter the shape of the spontaneous synaptic currents, suggesting that dopamine does not alter the postsynaptic muscle fiber receptiveness to the glutaminergic motor nerve transmission. The effects are presynaptic in causing a reduction in the number of vesicles that are stimulated to be released due to neural activity.},

abstract = {One of the rare examples of a single major gene underlying a naturally occurring behavioral polymorphism is the foraging locus of Drosophila melanogaster. Larvae with the rover allele, forR, have significantly longer foraging path lengths on a yeast paste than do those homozygous for the sitter allele, fors. These variants do not differ in general activity in the absence of food. The evolutionary significance of this polymorphism is not as yet understood. Here we examine the effect of high and low animal rearing densities on the larval foraging path-length phenotype and show that density-dependent natural selection produces changes in this trait. In three unrelated base populations the long path (rover) phenotype was selected for under high-density rearing conditions, whereas the short path (sitter) phenotype was selected for under low-density conditions. Genetic crosses suggested that these changes resulted from alterations in the frequency of the fors allele in the low-density-selected lines. Further experiments showed that density-dependent selection during the larval stage rather than the adult stage of development was sufficient to explain these results. Density-dependent mechanisms may be sufficient to maintain variation in rover and sitter behavior in laboratory populations.},

abstract = {fruitless (fru), originally identified with its mutant conferring male homosexuality, is a neural sex determination gene in Drosophila that produces sexually dimorphic sets of transcripts. In the nervous system, Fru is translated only in males. Fru proteins likely regulate the transcription of a set of downstream genes. The expression of Fru proteins is sufficient to induce male sexual behavior in females. A group of fru-expressing neurons called "mAL" neurons in the brain shows conspicuous sexual dimorphism. mAL is composed of 5 neurons in females and 30 neurons in males. It includes neurons with bilateral projections in males and contralateral projections in females. Terminal arborization patterns are also sexually dimorphic. These three characteristics are feminized in fru mutant males. The inactivation of cell death genes results in the production of additional mAL neurons that are of the male type in the female brain. This suggests that male-specific Fru inhibits mAL neuron death, leading to the formation of a male-specific neural circuit that underlies male sexual behavior. Fru orchestrates a spectrum of downstream genes as a master control gene to establish the maleness of the brain. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Using Drosophila mutants and pharmacological blockers, we provide the first evidence that distinct types of K+ channels differentially influence sub-cellular Ca2+ regulation and growth cone morphology during neuronal development. Fura-2-based imaging revealed in cultured embryonic neurons that the loss of either voltage-gated, inactivating Shaker channels or Ca2+-gated Slowpoke BK channels led to robust spontaneous Ca2+ transients that preferentially occurred within the growth cone. In contrast, loss of voltage-gated, non-inactivating Shab channels did not show such a disparity and sometimes produced soma-specific Ca2+ transients. The fast spontaneous transients in both the soma and growth cone were suppressed by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin, indicating that these Ca2+ fluctuations stemmed from increases in membrane excitability. Similar differences in regional Ca2+ regulation were observed upon membrane depolarization by high K+-containing saline. In particular, Shaker and slowpoke mutations enhanced the size and dynamics of the depolarization-induced Ca2+ increase in the growth cone. In contrast, Shab mutations greatly prolonged the Ca2+ increase in the soma. Differential effects of these excitability mutations on neuronal development were indicated by their distinct alterations in growth cone morphology. Loss of Shaker currents increased the size of lamellipodia and the number of filopodia, structures associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, loss of Slowpoke currents strongly influenced tubulin regulation, enhancing the number of microtubule loop structures per growth cone. Together, our findings support the idea that individual K+ channel subunits differentially regulate spontaneous sub-cellular Ca2+ fluctuations in growing neurons that may influence activity-dependent growth cone formation. ?? 2006 IBRO.},

This finding helps explain how animal responses can be consistent, despite the seeming advantages of flexible responses.

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) and natriuretic peptide hormones play key roles in a surprising number of neuronal functions, including learning and memory. Most data suggest that they exert converging actions by elevation of intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels through activation of soluble and particulate guanylyl cyclases. However, cGMP is only the starting point for multiple signaling cascades, which are now beginning to be defined. A primary action of elevated cGMP levels is the stimulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), the major intracellular receptor protein for cGMP, which phosphorylates substrate proteins to exert its actions. It has become increasingly clear that PKG mediates some of the neuronal effects of cGMP, but how is not yet clear. One clear illustration of this pathway has been reported in striatonigral nerve terminals, where NO mediates phosphorylation of the protein phosphatase regulator dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein having a molecular mass of 32,000 (DARPP-32) by PKG. There are remarkably few PKG substrates in brain whose identities are known. A survey of these proteins and those known from other tissues that might also be found in the nervous system reveals the key molecular sites where cGMP and PKG signaling is likely to be regulating neural function. These potential substrates are critically placed to have profound effects on the protein phosphorylation network through regulation of protein phosphatases, intracellular calcium levels, and the function of many ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. The brain also contains a rich diversity of specific PKG substrates whose identities are not yet known. Their future identification will provide exciting new leads that will permit better understanding of the role of PKG signaling in both basic and higher orders of brain function.},

At the subcellular level, ratiometric probes with expanded dynamics are now available to measure accurately the local Ca2+ changes occurring within specific cell compartments. These tools will allow to determine precisely the role of organelles and of cellular microdomains in Ca2+ handling. At the cellular level, the permanent labeling offered by the genetic probes enables large-scale, long-term Ca2+ measurements with robotic multiplexing technologies such as fluorescence plate readers or automated microscopes. This opens the way to large-scale pharmacological or genetic screens based on organelle-specific functional assays. At the whole animal level, probes with improved dynamics and reduced interference with endogenous proteins will allow to generate transgenic animals bearing Ca2+ sensitive indicators in specific cells and tissues. With this approach, Ca2+ signals can be recorded in neurons, heart, and pancreas of live animals during physiological and pathological stimulations.

abstract = {In recent years evidence has been accumulating that personalities are not only found in humans but also in a wide range of other animal species. Individuals differ consistently in their behavioural tendencies and the behaviour in one context is correlated with the behaviour in multiple other contexts. From an adaptive perspective, the evolution of animal personalities is still a mystery, because a more flexible structure of behaviour should provide a selective advantage. Accordingly, many researchers view personalities as resulting from constraints imposed by the architecture of behaviour (but see ref. 12). In contrast, we show here that animal personalities can be given an adaptive explanation. Our argument is based on the insight that the trade-off between current and future reproduction often results in polymorphic populations in which some individuals put more emphasis on future fitness returns than others. Life-history theory predicts that such differences in fitness expectations should result in systematic differences in risk-taking behaviour. Individuals with high future expectations (who have much to lose) should be more risk-averse than individuals with low expectations. This applies to all kinds of risky situations, so individuals should consistently differ in their behaviour. By means of an evolutionary model we demonstrate that this basic principle results in the evolution of animal personalities. It simultaneously explains the coexistence of behavioural types, the consistency of behaviour through time and the structure of behavioural correlations across contexts. Moreover, it explains the common finding that explorative behaviour and risk-related traits like boldness and aggressiveness are common characteristics of animal personalities.},

abstract = {In recent years, a number of tools have become available for remotely activating neural circuits in Drosophila. Despite widespread and growing use, very little work has been done to characterize exactly how these tools affect activity in identified fly neurons. Using the GAL4-UAS system, we expressed blue light-gated Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and a mutated form of ChR2 (H134R-ChR2) in motor and sensory neurons of the Drosophila third-instar locomotor circuit. Neurons expressing H134R-ChR2 show enhanced responses to blue light pulses and less spike frequency adaptation than neurons expressing ChR2. Although H134R-ChR2 was more effective at manipulating behavior than ChR2, the behavioral consequences of firing rate adaptation were different in sensory and motor neurons. For comparison, we examined the effects of ectopic expression of the warmth-activated cation channel Drosophila TRPA1 (dTRPA1). When dTRPA1 was expressed in larval motor neurons, heat ramps from 21 to 27 degrees C evoked tonic spiking at approximately 25 degrees C that showed little adaptation over many minutes. dTRPA1 activation had stronger and longer-lasting effects on behavior than ChR2 variants. These results suggest that dTRPA1 may be particularly useful for researchers interested in activating fly neural circuits over long time scales. Overall, this work suggests that understanding the cellular effects of these genetic tools and their temporal dynamics is important for the design and interpretation of behavioral experiments.},

abstract = {The ability to identify and respond to food is essential for survival, yet little is known about the neural substrates that regulate natural variation in food-related traits. The foraging (for) gene in Drosophila melanogaster encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and has been shown to function in food-related traits. To investigate the tissue distribution of FOR protein, we generated an antibody against a common region of the FOR isoforms. In the adult brain we localized FOR to neuronal clusters and projections including neurons that project to the central complex, a cluster within the dorsoposterior region of the brain hemispheres, a separate cluster medial to optic lobes and lateral to brain hemispheres, a broadly distributed frontal-brain cluster, axon bundles of the antennal nerve and of certain subesophageal-ganglion nerves, and the medulla optic lobe. These newly described tissue distribution patterns of FOR protein provide candidate neural clusters and brain regions for investigation of neural networks that govern foraging-related traits. To determine whether FOR has a behavioral function in neurons we expressed UAS-for in neurons using an elav-gal4 driver and measured the effect on adult sucrose responsiveness (SR), known to be higher in rovers than sitters, the two natural variants of foraging. We found that pan-neuronal expression of for caused an increase in the SR of sitters, demonstrating a neural function for PKG in this food-related behavior.},

The identity, kinetics and location of the vesicle pools that are mobilized by neuronal activity have been studied using a variety of techniques. We created a genetically encoded probe, biosyn, which consists of a biotinylated VAMP2 expressed at presynaptic terminals. We exploited the high-affinity interaction between streptavidin and biotin to label biosyn with fluorescent streptavidin during vesicle fusion. This approach allowed us to tag vesicles sequentially to visualize and establish the identity of presynaptic pools. Using this technique, we were able to distinguish between two different pools of vesicles in rat hippocampal neurons: one that was released in response to presynaptic activity and another, distinct vesicle pool that spontaneously fused with the plasma membrane. We found that the spontaneous vesicles belonged to a 'resting pool' that is normally not mobilized by neuronal activity and whose function was previously unknown.},

Each model system shows several of Thompson and Spencer's [Thompson, R. F., \& Spencer, W. A. (1966). Habituation: A model phenomenon for the study of neuronal substrates of behavior. Psychological Review, 73, 16-43] parametric criteria for habituation: spontaneous recovery and dishabituation have been described in almost all of them and dependence of habituation upon stimulus frequency and stimulus intensity in the majority. Stimulus generalization (and conversely, the delineation of stimulus specificity) has given insights into the localization of habituation or the neural architecture underlying sensory processing. The strength of Drosophila for studying habituation is the range of genetic approaches available. Mutations have been used to modify specific neuroanatomical structures, ion channels, elements of synaptic transmission, and second-messenger pathways. rutabaga and dunce, genes of the cAMP signal pathway that have been studied most often in the reviewed experiments, have also been implicated in synaptic plasticity and associative conditioning in Drosophila and other species including mammals. The use of the Gal4/UAS system for targeting gene expression has enabled genetic perturbation of defined sets of neurons. One clear lesson is that a gene may affect habituation differently in different behaviors, depending on the expression, processing, and localization of the gene product in specific circuits. Mutations of specific genes not only provide links between physiology and behavior in the same circuit, but also reveal common mechanisms in different paradigms of behavioral plasticity. The rich repertoire of models for habituation in the fly is an asset for combining a genetic approach with behavioral, anatomical and physiological methods with the promise of a more complete understanding. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Although intensively studied, the biological purpose of sleep is not known. To identify candidate genes affecting sleep, we assayed 136 isogenic P-element insertion lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Since sleep has been negatively correlated with energy reserves across taxa, we measured energy stores (whole-body protein, glycogen, and triglycerides) in these lines as well. Twenty-one insertions with known effects on physiology, development, and behavior affect 24-hr sleep time. Thirty-two candidate insertions significantly impact energy stores. Mutational genetic correlations among sleep parameters revealed that the genetic basis of the transition between sleep and waking states in males and females may be different. Furthermore, sleep bout number can be decoupled from waking activity in males, but not in females. Significant genetic correlations are present between sleep phenotypes and glycogen stores in males, while sleep phenotypes are correlated with triglycerides in females. Differences observed in male and female sleep behavior in flies may therefore be related to sex-specific differences in metabolic needs. Sleep thus emerges as a complex trait that exhibits extensive pleiotropy and sex specificity. The large mutational target that we observed implicates genes functioning in a variety of biological processes, suggesting that sleep may serve a number of different functions rather than a single purpose.},

abstract = {Institutional repositories-used in this paper to mean digital collections capturing and preserving the intellectual output of a single or multi-university community-provide a compelling response to two strategic issues facing academic institutions. Such repositories: Provide a critical component in reforming the system of scholarly communication-a component that expands access to research, reasserts control over scholarship by the academy, increases competition and reduces the monopoly power of journals, and brings economic relief and heightened relevance to the institutions and libraries that support them; and Have the potential to serve as tangible indicators of a university's quality and to demonstrate the scientific, societal, and economic relevance of its research activities, thus increasing the institution's visibility, status, and public value. Institutional repositories can provide an immediate and valuable complement to the existing scholarly publishing model, while stimulating innovation in a new disaggregated publishing structure that will evolve and improve over time. Further, they build on a growing grassroots faculty practice of self-posting research online. While institutional repositories necessitate that libraries-as their logical administrative proponents-facilitate development of university intellectual property policies, encourage faculty authors to retain the right to self-archive, and broaden both faculty and administration perspectives on these issues, they can be implemented without radically altering the status quo. Moreover, they can be introduced by reallocating existing resources, usually without extensive technical development. In sum, institutional repositories offer a strategic response to systemic problems in the existing scholarly journal system-and the response can be applied immediately, reaping both short-term and ongoing benefits for universities and their faculty and advancing the positive transformation of scholarly communication over the long term. This paper examines institutional repositories strategically, from two complementary perspectives: 1) as a natural extension of academic institutions' responsibility as generators of primary research seeking to preserve and leverage their constituents' intellectual assets; and 2) as one potentially major component in the evolving structure of scholarly communication. We describe the roles of institutional repositories in this structure and explore the impact on major stakeholders in the process and outcomes},

abstract = {Wandering is a simple behavior in Drosophila larvae prior to metamorphosis. Using the Dynamic Image Analysis System (DIAS) initially developed for analyzing amoeboic movements of single cells, we have analyzed videotaped behaviors of Drosophila larvae at the wandering stage. Previous studies show that mutations in the Na+ channel gene paralytic (para) cause paralysis at 29 degrees C, and mutations in the K+ channel beta subunit gene Hyperkinetic (Hk) lead to leg-shaking under ether anesthesia. The application of DIAS revealed quantifiable abnormalities in the larval locomotion of both ion channel mutants even under "permissive" conditions. Analysis of centroid movement indicates that, compared to wild type, both Hk and para larvae crawled at a slower average speed, but a similar peak instantaneous speed during a contraction cycle. Nevertheless, contraction in the body length was greater in mutants, implying a lower efficiency in conversion of muscular contraction to distance translocation. In addition, each mutant produced a characteristic crawling pattern distinct from the wild-type control. The larval crawling pattern was determined by periods of linear locomotion interposed by non-locomotive, "searching and decision-making" episodes, after which the crawling was resumed in a new direction. Our results demonstrate that mutations in single ion channel subunits resulted in stereotypic modifications in locomotion control and crawling patterns, and that DIAS is a powerful tool in revealing subtle differences in animal behavior and quantifying mutational effects on the interplay of discrete behavioral components.},

abstract = {Dendrites represent arborising neurites in both vertebrates and invertebrates. However, in vertebrates, dendrites develop on neuronal cell bodies, whereas in higher invertebrates, they arise from very different neuronal structures, the primary neurites, which also form the axons. Is this anatomical difference paralleled by principal developmental and/or physiological differences? We address this question by focussing on one cellular model, motorneurons of Drosophila and characterise the compartmentalisation of these cells. We find that motorneuronal dendrites of Drosophila share with typical vertebrate dendrites that they lack presynaptic but harbour postsynaptic proteins, display calcium elevation upon excitation, have distinct cytoskeletal features, develop later than axons and are preceded by restricted localisation of Par6-complex proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate in situ and culture that Drosophila dendrites can be shifted from the primary neurite to their soma, i.e. into vertebrate-like positions. Integrating these different lines of argumentation, we propose that dendrites in vertebrates and higher invertebrates have a common origin, and differences in dendrite location can be explained through translocation of neuronal cell bodies introduced during the evolutionary process by which arthropods and vertebrates diverged from a common urbilaterian ancestor. Implications of these findings for studies of dendrite development, neuronal polarity, transport and evolution are discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The development of the nervous system is influenced by environmental factors. Among all environmental factors, temperature belongs to a unique category. Besides activating some specific sensory pathways, it exerts nonspecific, pervasive effects directly on the entire nervous system, especially in exothermic species. This study uses mutants to genetically discover how temperature affects nerve terminal arborization at larval neuromuscular junctions of Drosophila. It is known that hyperexcitability in K(+) channel mutants leads to enhanced ramification of larval nerve terminals. Elevated cAMP levels in dunce mutants with reduced phosphodiesterase activity also cause enhanced arborization. These genetic alterations are thought to perturb mechanisms relevant to activity-dependent neural plasticity, in which neuronal activity activates the cAMP pathway, and consequently affect nerve terminal arborization by regulating expression of adhesion molecules. Here we demonstrate the robust influence of rearing temperature on motor nerve terminal arborization. Analysis of ion channel and cAMP pathway mutants indicates that this temperature-dependent plasticity is mediated via neuronal activity changes linked to mechanisms controlled by the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase.},

We examined motor axon terminals of (1) hyperexcitable mutants Shaker (Sh), ether a go-go (eag), Hyperkinetic (Hk), and Duplication of para+ (Dp para+); and (2) mutants with reduced excitability, no action potential (napts) and paralytic (parats 1). Nerve terminals innervating larval body-wall muscles were visualized by using anti-HRP immunocytochemistry, which specifically stains neurons in insect species. In wild-type larvae, motor axon terminals were distributed in a stereotypic fashion. However, in combinations of eag and Sh alleles, the basic pattern of innervation was altered. There was an increase in both the number of higher-order axonal branches over the muscles and the number of varicosities on the neurites. A similar phenomenon was found in the double mutant Hk eag and, to a lesser extent, in Dp para+ and Dp para+ Sh mutants. It is known that at permissive temperature the napts, but not parats 1, mutation decreases excitability of larval motor axons and suppresses the behavioral phenotypes of Sh, eag, and Hk. In the mutant napts (reared at permissive temperature), a slight decrease in the extent of branching was observed. Yet, when combined with eag Sh, napts completely reversed the morphological abnormality in eag Sh mutants. No such reversion was observed in parats 1 eag Sh mutants. The endogenous patterns of electrical activity at the neuromuscular junction were analyzed by extracellular recordings in a semi-intact larval preparation. Recordings from wild-type body-wall muscles revealed rhythmic bursts of spikes. In eag Sh mutants, this rhythmic activity was accompanied by or superimposed on periods of strong tonic activity. This abnormal pattern of activity could be partially suppressed by napts in combination with eag Sh.},

abstract = {The hypothalamo-hypophyseal system in vertebrates is in many respects similar to the intercerebralis-cardiacum-allatum system in insects.(1) In vertebrates the hypothalamic nuclei innervating the pars nervosa of the pituitary gland contain secreting nerve cells. In a number of species colloid droplets can be traced along the axons from the neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus to the hypophysis.(2) In insects the pars intercerebralis of the protocerebrum contains neurosecretory cells. A bundle (nervus corporis cardiaci) innervating the corpus cardiacum and probably also the corpus allatum originates in the pars intercerebralis. In Leucophaea (Orthoptera) as in the vertebrates, colloid can be traced from the secreting nerve cells of the pars intercerebralis to the corpora cardiaca all along the nervus corporis cardiaci.(3) On the basis of these morphological relationships the hypothalamic nuclei (nucleus preopticus and its homologues) and the pars nervosa of the hypophysis appear as one closely interconnected system. Likewise the pars intercerebralis and the corpus cardiacum of insects may be viewed as one neuro-endocrine complex rather than as two separate sources of hormones. In this way certain seemingly inconsistent data concerning the endocrine control of development in insects can be better understood (see p. 244).},

abstract = {Neuroligins belong to a highly conserved family of cell adhesion molecules that have been implicated in synapse formation and function. However, the precise in vivo roles of Neuroligins remain unclear. In the present study, we have analyzed the function of Drosophila neuroligin 2 (dnl2) in synaptic development and function. We show that dnl2 is strongly expressed in the embryonic and larval CNS and at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). dnl2 null mutants are viable but display numerous structural defects at the NMJ, including reduced axonal branching and fewer synaptic boutons. dnl2 mutants also show an increase in the number of active zones per bouton but a decrease in the thickness of the subsynaptic reticulum and length of postsynaptic densities. dnl2 mutants also exhibit a decrease in the total glutamate receptor density and a shift in the subunit composition of glutamate receptors in favor of GluRIIA complexes. In addition to the observed defects in synaptic morphology, we also find that dnl2 mutants show increased transmitter release and altered kinetics of stimulus-evoked transmitter release. Importantly, the defects in presynaptic structure, receptor density, and synaptic transmission can be rescued by postsynaptic expression of dnl2. Finally, we show that dnl2 colocalizes and binds to Drosophila neurexin (dnrx) in vivo. However, whereas homozygous mutants for either dnl2 or dnrx are viable, double mutants are lethal and display more severe defects in synaptic morphology. Altogether, our data show that, although dnl2 is not absolutely required for synaptogenesis, it is required postsynaptically for synapse maturation and function.},

abstract = {Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are concentrated at neuromuscular synapses in many species, including Drosophila. We have established the physiological and patterning functions of HSPGs at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction by using mutations that block heparan sulfate synthesis or sulfation to compromise HSPG function. The mutant animals showed defects in synaptic physiology and morphology suggesting that HSPGs function both presynaptically and postsynaptically; these defects could be rescued by appropriate transgene expression. Of particular interest were selective disruptions of mitochondrial localization, abnormal distributions of Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum markers in the muscle, and a markedly increased level of stimulus-dependent endocytosis in the motoneuron. Our data support the emerging view that HSPG functions are not limited to the cell surface and matrix environments, but also affect a diverse set of cellular processes including membrane trafficking and organelle distributions.},

@article{Benzer1967,
abstract = {Complex as it is, much of the vast network of cellular functions has been success- fully dissected, on a microscopic scale, by the use of mutants in which one element is altered at a time. A similar approach may be fruitful in tackling the complex structures and events underlying behavior, using behavioral mutations to indicate modifications of the nervous system. Drosophila offers the same advantages to such a study as it did to classical genetics, namely, large numbers and short generation time, to which may now be added an enormous store of accumulated knowledge concerning the organism. Containing about 105 neurons, the fly's nervous system is roughly halfway, on a logarithmic scale, between a single neuron and the human brain, and the fly is possessed of a rich repertoire of behavior. The considerable literature on Drosophila behavior since Carpenter's 1905 paper' has recently been re- viewed by Manning.2 Multiple T-mazes and related devices have been used to fractionate populations according to their geotactic or phototactic responses, or spontaneous activity.3 This was pioneered by Hirsch and his colleagues,3 who started with a genetically heterogeneous pool obtained by mixing diverse wild strains and showed that pro- gressive selection yields strains showing hereditary changes in behavior. Such selection depends upon the recombination and additive effects of multiple genes that can prove quite difficult to disentangle. Since it is now possible to produce very high mutation rates in Drosophila, one can, instead, use an inbred strain and isolate mutants in which a behavioral change occurs by a single step, so that direct relationships between individual genes and the nervous system may be investigated. The method described here for fractionating populations is analogous to counter- current distribution,7 an eminently effective method of separating molecules from a mixture by their partition between two solvent phases. Using, instead, the relative preference of an organism for two behavioral alternatives, one obtains rapid, simultaneous measurements on many subjects. The present paper describes the procedure and the isolation of mutants showing changes in phototactic behavior.},

In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses revealed highly enriched expression of DAMB in mushroom bodies, in a pattern coincident with the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase. The spatial coexpression of DAMB and the cyclase, along with DAMB's capacity to mediate dopamine-induced increases in cAMP make this receptor an attractive candidate for initiating biochemical cascades underlying learning.},

abstract = {Carbon-fiber microelectrodes coupled with electrochemical detection have been used extensively for the analysis of biogenic amines. In order to determine the functional role of these amines, in vivo studies have primarily used rats and mice as model organisms. Here, we report on the development of these microanalytical techniques for in vivo electrochemical detection of dopamine in the adult Drosophila melanogaster central nervous system (CNS). A triple-barrel micropipet injector was used to exogenously apply three different concentrations of dopamine, and a cylindrical carbon-fiber microelectrode was placed in the protocerebral anterior medial brain area where dopamine neurons are densely populated. Background-subtracted fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was used to measure dopamine concentration in the fly CNS. Distinct differences are shown for the clearance of exogenously applied dopamine in the brains of wild type flies versus fumin (fmn) mutants lacking a functional dopamine transporter. The current response due to oxidation of dopamine increased significantly from baseline for wild type flies following cocaine incubation. Interestingly, the current remained unchanged for mutant flies under the same conditions. These data confirm the accepted theory that cocaine blocks dopamine transporter function and validates the use of in vivo electrochemical methods to monitor dopamine uptake in Drosophila. Furthermore, after incubation with tetrodotoxin (TTX), a sodium channel blocker, there was a significant increase in peak oxidation current in the wild type flies; however, the current did not significantly change in the fmn mutant. These data suggest that factors that affect neuronal activity via ion channels such as TTX also influence the function of the dopamine transporter in Drosophila.},

abstract = {The dynamics of a wide range of real systems, from email patterns to earthquakes, display a bursty, intermittent nature, characterized by short timeframes of intensive activity followed by long times of no or reduced activity. The understanding of the origin of such bursty patterns is hindered by the lack of tools to compare different systems using a common framework. We introduce two measures to distinguish the mechanisms responsible for the bursty nature of real signals, changes in the interevent times and memory. We find that while the burstiness of natural phenomena is rooted in both the interevent time distribution and memory, for human dynamics memory is weak, and the bursty character is due to changes in the interevent time distribution. Finally, we show that current models lack in their ability to reproduce the activity pattern observed in real systems, opening up new avenues for future work.},

@article{Jarecki1995,
abstract = {This article reveals a novel aspect in the regulation of synaptic connectivity in Drosophila. Reducing neural activity genetically or pharmacologically disrupts the normally precise embryonic and larval neuromuscular connections. In third instar larvae with mutations that affect sodium channel function or expression such as no action potential, temperature-induced paralysis E, or seizure1, foreign neuromuscular synapses, arising from inappropriate nerve sources, are observed on muscle fibers throughout the abdominal body wall. Their frequencies increase as neural activity is further reduced in double mutant combinations. These foreign connections are first observed during late embryogenesis as filopodial-like contacts, but critical period analysis suggests that neural activity must be reduced during both late embryogenesis and the first larval instar to promote the differentiation of these embryonic contacts into foreign motor synapses. In addition, the loss of electrical activity in the motoneuron, as opposed to the loss of postsynaptic potentials in the muscle fibers, appears to be responsible for these changes in connectivity. Our experiments suggest that neural activity may function during development by preventing inappropriate connections and thereby maintaining the precise connectivity achieved during nerve outgrowth and target selection.},

abstract = {Hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels belong to the superfamily of voltage-gated pore loop channels. HCN channels are unique among vertebrate voltage-gated ion channels, in that they have a reverse voltage-dependence that leads to activation upon hyperpolarization. In addition, voltage-dependent opening of these channels is directly regulated by the binding of cAMP. HCN channels are encoded by four genes (HCN1-4) and are widely expressed throughout the heart and the central nervous system. The current flowing through HCN channels, designated I(h) or I(f), plays a key role in the control of cardiac and neuronal rhythmicity ("pacemaker current"). In addition, I(h) contributes to several other neuronal processes, including determination of resting membrane potential, dendritic integration and synaptic transmission. In this review we give an overview on structure, function and regulation of HCN channels. Particular emphasis will be laid on the complex roles of these channels for neuronal function and cardiac rhythmicity.},

@article{Andretic2005,
abstract = {Background: Arousal levels in the brain set thresholds for behavior, from simple to complex. The mechanistic underpinnings of the various phenomena comprising arousal, however, are still poorly understood. Drosophila behaviors have been studied that span different levels of arousal, from sleep to visual perception to psychostimulant responses. Results: We have investigated neurobiological mechanisms of arousal in the Drosophila brain by a combined behavioral, genetic, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approach. Administration of methamphetamine (METH) suppresses sleep and promotes active wakefulness, whereas an inhibitor of dopamine synthesis promotes sleep. METH affects courtship behavior by increasing sexual arousal while decreasing successful sexual performance. Electrophysiological recordings from the medial protocerebrum of wild-type flies showed that METH ingestion has rapid and detrimental effects on a brain response associated with perception of visual stimuli. Recordings in genetically manipulated animals show that dopaminergic transmission is required for these responses and that visual-processing deficits caused by attenuated dopaminergic transmission can be rescued by METH. Conclusions: We show that changes in dopamine levels differentially affect arousal for behaviors of varying complexity. Complex behaviors, such as visual perception, degenerate when dopamine levels are either too high or too low, in accordance with the inverted-U hypothesis of dopamine action in the mammalian brain. Simpler behaviors, such as sleep and locomotion, show graded responses that follow changes in dopamine level. ??2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The mushroom body (MB) of the insect brain has important roles in odor learning and memory and in diverse other brain functions. To elucidate the anatomical basis underlying its function, we studied how the MB of Drosophila is organized by its intrinsic and extrinsic neurons. We screened for the GAL4 enhancer-trap strains that label specific subsets of these neurons and identified seven subtypes of Kenyon cells and three other intrinsic neuron types. Laminar organization of the Kenyon cell axons divides the pedunculus into at least five concentric strata. The alpha', beta', alpha, and beta lobes are each divided into three strata, whereas the gamma lobe appears more homogeneous. The outermost stratum of the alpha/beta lobes is specifically connected with a small, protruded subregion of the calyx, the accessory calyx, which does not receive direct olfactory input. As for the MB extrinsic neurons (MBENs), we found three types of antennal lobe projection neurons, among which two are novel. In addition, we resolved 17 other types of MBENs that arborize in the calyx, lobes, and pedunculus. Lobe-associated MBENs arborize in only specific areas of the lobes, being restricted along their longitudinal axes, forming two to five segmented zones in each lobe. The laminar arrangement of the Kenyon cell axons and segmented organization of the MBENs together divide the lobes into smaller synaptic units, possibly facilitating characteristic interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic neurons in each unit for different functional activities along the longitudinal lobe axes and between lobes. Structural differences between lobes are also discussed.},

abstract = {Dopamine is found in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues in the larval stage of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and functions as a signaling molecule in the nervous system. Although dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) were previously thought solely to be interneurons, recent studies suggest that dopamine may also act as a neuromodulator in humoral pathways. We examined both application of dopamine on intact larval CNS-segmental preparations and isolated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Dopamine rapidly decreased the rhythmicity of the CNS motor activity. Application of dopamine on neuromuscular preparations of the segmental muscles 6 and 7 resulted in a dose-responsive decrease in the excitatory junction potentials (EJPs). With the use of focal, macro-patch synaptic current recordings the quantal evoked transmission showed a depression of vesicular release at concentrations of 10 microM. Higher concentrations (1 mM) produced a rapid decrement in evoked vesicular release.

abstract = {Dopamine is necessary for the aversive olfactory associative memory formation in Drosophila, but its effect on other stages of memory is not known. Herein, we studied the effect of enhanced dopaminergic signaling on aversive olfactory memory retention in flies. We used l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to elevate dopamine levels: l-DOPA-treated flies exhibited a normal learning performance, but a decrease in 1-h memory. Dopamine transporter (DAT) mutant flies or flies treated with the DAT inhibitor desipramine exhibited poor memory retention. Flies subjected to heat stress after training exhibited a decrease in memory. Memory was restored by blocking dopaminergic neuronal output during heat stress, suggesting that dopamine is involved in heat stress-induced memory impairment in flies. Taken together, our findings suggest that increased dopaminergic signaling impairs aversive olfactory memory retention in flies. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Dopamine is found in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues in the larval stage of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and functions as a signaling molecule in the nervous system. Although dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) were previously thought solely to be interneurons, recent studies suggest that dopamine may also act as a neuromodulator in humoral pathways. We examined both application of dopamine on intact larval CNS-segmental preparations and isolated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Dopamine rapidly decreased the rhythmicity of the CNS motor activity. Application of dopamine on neuromuscular preparations of the segmental muscles 6 and 7 resulted in a dose-responsive decrease in the excitatory junction potentials (EJPs). With the use of focal, macro-patch synaptic current recordings the quantal evoked transmission showed a depression of vesicular release at concentrations of 10 microM. Higher concentrations (1 mM) produced a rapid decrement in evoked vesicular release. Dopamine did not alter the shape of the spontaneous synaptic currents, suggesting that dopamine does not alter the postsynaptic muscle fiber receptiveness to the glutaminergic motor nerve transmission. The effects are presynaptic in causing a reduction in the number of vesicles that are stimulated to be released due to neural activity.},

abstract = {Despite an immense amount of variation in organisms throughout the animal kingdom many of their genes show substantial conservation in DNA sequence and protein function. Here we explore the potential for a conserved evolutionary relationship between genes and their behavioural phenotypes. We investigate the evolutionary history of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and its possible conserved function in food-related behaviours. First identified for its role in the foraging behaviour of fruit flies, the PKG encoded by the foraging gene has since been associated with the maturation of behaviour (from nurse to forager) in honey bees and the roaming and dwelling food-related locomotion in nematodes. These parallels encouraged us to construct protein phylogenies using 32 PKG sequences that include 19 species. Our analyses suggest five possible evolutionary histories that can explain the apparent conserved link between PKG and behaviour in fruit flies, honey bees and nematodes. Three of these raise the hypothesis that PKG influences the food-related behaviours of a wide variety of animals including vertebrates. Moreover, it appears that the PKG gene was duplicated some time between the evolution of nematodes and a common ancestor of vertebrates and insects whereby current evidence suggests only the for-like PKG might be associated with food-related behaviour.},

Colloquial notions of uncertainty, particularly when describing a decision as 'risky', often carry connotations of potential danger as well. Gambling on a long shot, whether a horse at the racetrack or a foreign oil company in a hedge fund, can have negative consequences, but the impact of uncertainty on decision making extends beyond gambling. Indeed, uncertainty in some form pervades nearly all our choices in daily life. Stepping into traffic to hail a cab, braving an ice storm to be the first at work, or dating the boss's son or daughter also offer potentially great windfalls, at the expense of surety. We continually face trade-offs between options that promise safety and others that offer an uncertain potential for jackpot or bust. When mechanisms for dealing with uncertain outcomes fail, as in mental disorders such as problem gambling or addiction, the results can be disastrous. Thus, understanding decision making-indeed, understanding behavior itself-requires knowing how the brain responds to and uses information about uncertainty.},

Traditional measurements of aggressive behavior have relied on a territorial context with a food territory and a female as factors that induce or enhance aggression. The protocol described here is devoid of a food territory or a female, making it simpler than most existing methods used to measure aggressive behavior. Multiple pairs of males are tested simultaneously to obtain an average fighting score. Four parameters are used to quantify the behavior: frequency, index, latency and intensity of fighting based on unambiguous offensive fighting behaviors. The assay takes 15 min, during which time a frequency score is obtained for 20-35 pairs simultaneously. More in-depth analysis, including latency, index and intensity, can be performed on the videotaped record of the experiment. The assay is highly reproducible and requires limited resources in a simple setup.},

In insects such as the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, DA also modulates a wide array of behaviours, ranging from sleep and locomotion to courtship and learning. How can a single molecule play so many different roles? Adaptive changes within the DA system, anatomical specificity of action and effects on a variety of behaviours highlight the remarkable versatility of this neurotransmitter. Recent genetic and pharmacological manipulations of DA signalling in Drosophila have launched a surfeit of stories-each arguing for modulation of some aspect of the fly's waking (and sleeping) life. Although these stories often seem distinct and unrelated, there are some unifying themes underlying DA function and arousal states in this insect model. One of the central roles played by DA may involve perceptual suppression, a necessary component of both sleep and selective attention.},

abstract = {Mushroom bodies (MBs), one of the central brain structures in Drosophila melanogaster, are involved in several cognitive behaviors, such as olfactory learning and memory, visual context generalization, choice behavior facing conflicting cues. Attention is a cognitive behavior, and it facilitates a focus on the attended event while filtering out irrelevant events, thereby allowing more rapid and accurate reactions at a lower threshold in primates. Using the visual orientation paradigm in a flight simulator, we observed that MBs modulate salience-based selective fixation behavior, which resembles attention in primates to a certain degree. We found that the fixation ability of MB-deficient flies was significantly reduced when the contrast levels were lowered as well as when a certain amount of background noise was applied. Moreover, MB-deficient flies exhibited poor object fixation ability in the presence of an olfactory 'distracter'. Furthermore, during visual selection among multiple objects of different contrast, flies with MBs were able to 'pop-out' of the most salient object in a three-object selection paradigm. Finally, we determined that flies exhibited cross-modal synergistic integration between olfactory and visual signals during object-fixation behavior, which was independent of MBs. Taken together, our findings suggest that MBs do not contribute to cross-modal synergetic integration between olfactory and visual signals; instead, they confer sensory gain control and inhibitory gating in flies, this property allows entry of the salient signal as well as filters out background noise and irrelevant signals.},

abstract = {Learning and memory is not an attribute of higher animals. Even Drosophila larvae are able to form and recall an association of a given odor with an aversive or appetitive gustatory reinforcer. As the Drosophila larva has turned into a particularly simple model for studying odor processing, a detailed neuronal and functional map of the olfactory pathway is available up to the third order neurons in the mushroom bodies. At this point, a convergence of olfactory processing and gustatory reinforcement is suggested to underlie associative memory formation. The dopaminergic system was shown to be involved in mammalian and insect olfactory conditioning. To analyze the anatomy and function of the larval dopaminergic system, we first characterize dopaminergic neurons immunohistochemically up to the single cell level and subsequent test for the effects of distortions in the dopamine system upon aversive (odor-salt) as well as appetitive (odor-sugar) associative learning. Single cell analysis suggests that dopaminergic neurons do not directly connect gustatory input in the larval suboesophageal ganglion to olfactory information in the mushroom bodies. However, a number of dopaminergic neurons innervate different regions of the brain, including protocerebra, mushroom bodies and suboesophageal ganglion. We found that dopamine receptors are highly enriched in the mushroom bodies and that aversive and appetitive olfactory learning is strongly impaired in dopamine receptor mutants. Genetically interfering with dopaminergic signaling supports this finding, although our data do not exclude on na\"{\i}ve odor and sugar preferences of the larvae. Our data suggest that dopaminergic neurons provide input to different brain regions including protocerebra, suboesophageal ganglion and mushroom bodies by more than one route. We therefore propose that different types of dopaminergic neurons might be involved in different types of signaling necessary for aversive and appetitive olfactory memory formation respectively, or for the retrieval of these memory traces. Future studies of the dopaminergic system need to take into account such cellular dissociations in function in order to be meaningful.},

abstract = {Hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels belong to the superfamily of voltage-gated pore loop channels. HCN channels are unique among vertebrate voltage-gated ion channels, in that they have a reverse voltage-dependence that leads to activation upon hyperpolarization. In addition, voltage-dependent opening of these channels is directly regulated by the binding of cAMP. HCN channels are encoded by four genes (HCN1-4) and are widely expressed throughout the heart and the central nervous system. The current flowing through HCN channels, designated I(h) or I(f), plays a key role in the control of cardiac and neuronal rhythmicity ("pacemaker current"). In addition, I(h) contributes to several other neuronal processes, including determination of resting membrane potential, dendritic integration and synaptic transmission. In this review we give an overview on structure, function and regulation of HCN channels. Particular emphasis will be laid on the complex roles of these channels for neuronal function and cardiac rhythmicity.},

HCN channels underlie the hyperpolarization-activated current, Ih, an important regulator of excitability and rhythmicity through control of basic membrane properties. Ih is present in multiple neuronal types and regions of the central nervous system, and changes in Ih alter cellular input-output properties and neuronal circuitry important for behavior such as learning and memory. Furthermore, the pathophysiology of neurological diseases of both the central and peripheral nervous system involves defects in excitability, rhythmicity, and signaling, and animal models of many of these disorders have implicated changes in HCN channels and Ih as critical for pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on recent research elucidating the role of HCN channels and Ih in behavior and disease. These studies have utilized knockout mice as well as animal models of disease to examine how Ih may be important in regulating learning and memory, sleep, and consciousness, as well as how misregulation of Ih may contribute to epilepsy, chronic pain, and other neurological disorders.

Here, we show that PINK1 mutants exhibit indirect flight muscle and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration accompanied by locomotive defects. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy analysis and a rescue experiment with Drosophila Bcl-2 demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction accounts for the degenerative changes in all phenotypes of PINK1 mutants. Notably, we also found that PINK1 mutants share marked phenotypic similarities with parkin mutants. Transgenic expression of Parkin markedly ameliorated all PINK1 loss-of-function phenotypes, but not vice versa, suggesting that Parkin functions downstream of PINK1. Taken together, our genetic evidence clearly establishes that Parkin and PINK1 act in a common pathway in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function in both muscles and dopaminergic neurons.},

The dynamic interplay of both processes contributes to the expression of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Here, we exploited various facets of short-term plasticity at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction to dissect these two processes. This enabled us to rigorously analyze different models of synaptic vesicle pools in terms of their size and mobilization properties. Independent of the specific model, we estimate approximately 300 readily releasable vesicles with an average release probability of approximately 50\% in 1 mM extracellular calcium ( approximately 5\% in 0.4 mM extracellular calcium) under resting conditions. The models also helped interpreting the altered short-term plasticity of the previously reported mutant of the active zone component Bruchpilot (BRP). Finally, our results were independently confirmed through fluctuation analysis. Our data reveal that the altered short-term plasticity observed in BRP mutants cannot be accounted for by delocalized Ca(2+) channels alone and thus suggest an additional role of BRP in short-term plasticity.},

The Drosophila melanogaster homolog of human CASK (also known as caki or camguk) is a molecular scaffold that has been postulated to have roles in both locomotion and plasticity. These conclusions are based on studies using overlapping deficiencies that largely eliminate the entire CASK locus, but contain additional chromosomal aberrations as well. More importantly, analysis of the sequenced Drosophila genome suggests the existence of multiple protein variants from the CASK locus, further complicating the interpretation of experiments using deficiency strains. In this study, we generated small deletions within the CASK gene that eliminate gene products containing the CaMK-like and L27 domains (CASK-$\beta$), but do not affect transcripts encoding the smaller forms (CASK-$\alpha$), which are structurally homologous to vertebrate MPP1. These mutants have normal olfactory habituation, but exhibit a striking array of locomotor problems that includes both initiation and motor maintenance defects. Previous studies had suggested that presynaptic release defects at the neuromuscular junction in the multigene deficiency strain were the likely basis of its locomotor phenotype. The locomotor phenotype of the CASK-$\beta$ mutant, however, cannot be rescued by expression of a CASK-$\beta$ transgene in motor neurons. Expression in a subset of central neurons that does not include the ellipsoid body, a well-known pre-motor neuropil, provides complete rescue. Full-length CASK-$\beta$, while widely expressed in the nervous system, appears to have a unique role within central circuits that control motor output.},

abstract = {Spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion is a common property of all synapses. To trace the origin of spontaneously fused vesicles in hippocampal synapses, we tagged vesicles with fluorescent styryl dyes, antibodies against synaptotagmin-1, or horseradish peroxidase. We could show that synaptic vesicles recycle at rest, and after spontaneous exo-endocytosis, they populate a reluctantly releasable pool of limited size. Interestingly, vesicles in this spontaneously labeled pool were more likely to re-fuse spontaneously compared to vesicles labeled with activity. We found that blocking vesicle refilling at rest selectively depleted neurotransmitter from spontaneously fusing vesicles without significantly altering evoked transmission. Furthermore, in the absence of the vesicle SNARE protein synaptobrevin (VAMP), activity-dependent and spontaneously recycling vesicles could mix, suggesting a role for synaptobrevin in the separation of the two pools. Taken together these results suggest that spontaneously recycling vesicles and activity-dependent recycling vesicles originate from distinct pools with limited cross-talk with each other.},

abstract = {The functions of sleep and what controls it remain unanswered biological questions. According to the two-process model, a circadian process and a homeostatic process interact to regulate sleep. While progress has been made in understanding the molecular and cellular functions of the circadian process, the mechanisms of the homeostatic process remain undiscovered. We use the recently established sleep model system organism Drosophila melanogaster to examine dynamic changes in gene expression during sleep and during prolonged wakefulness in the brain. Our experimental design controls for circadian processes by killing animals at three matched time points from the beginning of the consolidated rest period [Zeitgeber time (ZT) 14)] under two conditions, sleep deprived and spontaneously sleeping. Using ANOVA at a false discovery rate of 5\%, we have identified 252 genes that were differentially expressed between sleep-deprived and control groups in the Drosophila brain. Using linear trends analysis, we have separated the significant differentially expressed genes into nine temporal expression patterns relative to a common anchor point (ZT 14). The most common expression pattern is a decrease during extended wakefulness but no change during spontaneous sleep (n = 114). Genes in this category were involved in protein production (n = 47), calcium homeostasis, and membrane excitability (n = 5). Multiple mechanisms, therefore, act to limit wakefulness. In addition, by studying the effects of the mechanical stimulus used in our deprivation studies during the period when the animals are predominantly active, we provide evidence for a previously unappreciated role for the Drosophila immune system in the brain response to stress.},

abstract = {To determine the role played by the giant fiber interneurons (GFs) in coordinating the jumping stages of visually elicited and olfactory-induced fight initiation we have recorded extracellularly from the cervical connective nerve during flight initiation. A spike is recorded from the cervical connective upon brain stimulation that has the same threshold as does activation of the tergotrochanteral muscle (TTM) and dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs). A consistent time interval occurs between the spike and activation of the TTM. Thus, the spike probably results from activity in the GFs. The time intervals between the spike and activation of the TTM during GF stimulation and visually elicited flight initiation are similar. These results suggest that the GFs coordinate the activation of the TTM and DLMs during the jumping stage of visually elicited flight initiation. A spike is also recorded from the cervical connective during olfactory-induced flight initiations, but its shape and the time interval between it and activation of the TTM is different from that observed during GF stimulation. Although some olfactory-induced flight initiations exhibit a pattern of muscle activation, olfactory-induced flight initiations exhibit a pattern of muscle activation indistinguishable from that evoked by GF stimulation, our results indicate that regardless of the pattern of muscle activation, olfactory-induced flight initiations are not coordinated by the GF circuit. The sterotypic sequence and timing of activation of TTM and DLMs characteristic of the GF pathway can, therefore, be evoked by neurons other than those constituting the GF pathway.},

We have examined the role of this pathway in the regulation of sleep in Drosophila melanogaster. Our results demonstrate that rhomboid (Rho)- and Star-mediated activation of EGFR and ERK signaling increases sleep in a dose-dependent manner, and that blockade of rhomboid (rho) expression in the nervous system decreases sleep. The requirement of rho for sleep localized to the pars intercerebralis, a part of the fly brain that is developmentally and functionally analogous to the hypothalamus in vertebrates.

abstract = {Surveys of open repository implementers over recent years have clearly highlighted the $\backslash$"institutional$\backslash$" focus of institutional repositories (IRs).[2] The stated motivations for implementing IRs uniformly emphasize the requirements of the host institution, while the benefits claimed for individual users and contributors are either those of the institution extended to them, or are obvious goals such as enabling greater access to information or providing managed, long-term preservation of artifacts. Meanwhile, these same surveys identify the challenge of maintaining a constant stream of contributions from the community as the chronic threat to the health of most active repositories; although each of the mainstream open repository platforms has been designed for self-service ingestion, it is widely acknowledged that the strongest and most up-to-date repositories are those that have professional staff who are responsible for content management, a luxury that few institutions can afford. Even those institutions that have implemented mandatory submission policies, especially in light of publishers' policies the are increasingly favorable to the principles of open access, still have not been able to achieve high levels of participation. The simple truth is that contribution to an IR today represents extra effort for the busy scholar, effort that doesn't add real value to their research, their authorship, or their collaboration with others in their field. We believe that scholars’ interactions with their local IRs should be more natural and more tightly integrated with their daily research activities. In particular we would like to give researchers stronger incentives to $\backslash$"live$\backslash$" within their DSpace, driven by features that motivate them to spend significant time there, manage their content there, and ultimately to make both the submission of research materials into the IR and the sharing of data and information with colleagues a natural, effortless aspect of their work. Fundamentally, we believe that the scholar’s personal “space” within a DSpace should augment and simplify their research activities, not a valueless canard on their already cluttered work processes. As a first step, we believe that the user should have basic — but in this Web2.0 world, expected — capabilities that relate their current activities and interests to other artifacts in their host IR, so at HPLabs we are actively experimenting with features like item bookmarking and personal tagging within local DSpace collections and using the resulting research contexts as a basis for recommending items related to the researcher's interests. Moving forward, we are exploring how to leverage this capability as a basis for identifying and retrieving related items within the local repository's federation[3] and especially for identifying colleagues who are discovered to have related interests. Finally, we are investigating ways to apply these basic techniques to the problem of identifying and harvesting related materials from other, heterogeneous sources such as external blogs, wikis, and web sources, and combining them with methods for managing the publication and sharing of research artifacts within the individual's scholarly network(s).},

Ih activation is obligatory for inducing long-term facilitation (LTF), a long-lasting synaptic strengthening. cAMP-induced synaptic enhancement also requires Ih activation, and both processes are sensitive to actin depolymerization. Other mechanisms are responsible for expression of the responses. Once initiated, continued response to cAMP is Ih and actin independent. Moreover, LTF-induced activation of Ih renders subsequent cAMP enhancement insensitive to both Ih blockers and actin depolymerization.

This is just one example among several human-oriented services which are strongly affected by human activity patterns. Recent empirical evidence is indicating that human activity patterns are characterized by power-law distributions of inter-event times, where large fluctuations rather than regularity is the common case. I show that this temporal heterogeneity can be explained by two mechanisms: (i) humans have some perception of their past activity rate and (ii) based on that they react by accelerating or reducing their activity rate. Using these two mechanisms I explain the inter-event time statistics of Darwin's and Einstein's correspondence and the email activity within an university environment. Moreover, they are typical examples of the accelerating and reducing class, respectively. These results are relevant to the system design of human-oriented services. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Adult mammals cycle between periods of sleep and wakefulness. Recent assessments of these cycles in humans and other mammals indicate that sleep bout durations exhibit an exponential distribution, whereas wake bout durations exhibit a power-law distribution. Moreover, it was found that wake bout distributions, but not sleep bout distributions, exhibit scale invariance across mammals of different body sizes. Here we test the generalizability of these findings by examining the distributions of sleep and wake bout durations in infant rats between 2 and 21 days of age. In agreement with Lo et al., we find that sleep bout durations exhibit exponential distributions at all ages examined. In contrast, however, wake bout durations also exhibit exponential distributions at the younger ages, with a clear power-law distribution only emerging at the older ages. Further analyses failed to find substantial evidence either of short- or long-term correlations in the data, thus suggesting that the durations of current sleep and wake bouts evolve through time without memory of the durations of preceding bouts. These findings further support the notion that bouts of sleep and wakefulness are regulated independently. Moreover, in light of recent evidence that developmental changes in sleep and wake bouts can be attributed in part to increasing forebrain influences, these findings suggest the possibility of identifying specific neural circuits that modulate the changing complexity of sleep and wake dynamics during development.},

Here, we demonstrate the involvement of the hyperpolarization-activated cation channel (Ih) in the expression of mossy fiber LTP. Established LTP was blocked and reversed by Ih channel antagonists. Whole-cell recording from granule cells revealed that repetitive stimulation causes a calcium- and Ih-dependent long-lasting depolarization mediated by protein kinase A. Depolarization at the terminals would be expected to enhance transmitter release, whereas somatic depolarization would enhance the responsiveness of granule cells to afferent input. Thus, Ih channels play an important role in the long-lasting control of transmitter release and neuronal excitability.},

abstract = {The brain of the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme required for catecholamine biosynthesis, as well as dopa decarboxylase. Catecholamines, principally dopamine, are also present. We have previously shown that pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine results in a dose-related inhibition of locomotor activity in adult organisms. Similar results were found with reserpine, a well-known inhibitor of catecholamine uptake into storage granules. The drug-induced inhibition could be prevented in each case by the concomitant administration of L-dopa. The single-copy gene coding for tyrosine hydroxylase in Drosophila is pale (ple). Both null and temperature-sensitive loss of function mutant alleles of ple are recessive embryonic lethals. Heterozygous null mutant flies have normal locomotor activity demonstrating that only a single dose of the wild type form of ple is required to support normal function. Both hemizygous and homozygous temperature-sensitive ple mutants (ple(ts1)) also show normal locomotor activity at the permissive temperature for this mutant allele (18 degrees C), which progressively declines as the temperature is increased to its restrictive level (29 degrees C). These abnormal locomotor effects are reversible by L-dopa. Thus the effects on locomotor activity resulting from the pharmacological inhibition of catecholamine synthesis or storage are the same as those resulting from lack of tyrosine hydroxylase expression. These findings indicate that brain catecholamine loss decreases locomotor activity in the fly, as it does in mammals, and demonstrate the ability of functional genomic studies to mimic that of pharmacological inhibition of enzyme function or other similar processes.},

abstract = {Rhythmic movements, such as peristaltic contraction, are initiated by output from central pattern generator (CPG) networks in the CNS. These oscillatory networks elicit locomotion in the absence of external sensory or descending inputs, but CPG circuits produce more directed and behaviorally relevant movement via peripheral nervous system (PNS) input. Drosophila melanogaster larval locomotion results from patterned muscle contractions moving stereotypically along the body segments, but without PNS feedback, contraction of body segments is uncoordinated. We have dissected the role of a subset of mechanosensory neurons in the larval PNS, the chordotonal organs (chos), in providing sensory feedback to the locomotor CPG circuit with dias (Dynamic Image Analysis System) software. We analyzed mutants carrying cho mutations including atonal, a cho proneural gene, beethoven, a cho cilia class mutant, smetana and touch-insensitive larva B, two axonemal mutants, and 5D10, a weak cho mutant. All cho mutants have defects in gross path morphology compared to controls. These mutants exhibit increased frequency and duration of turning (decision-making) and reduced duration of linear locomotion. Furthermore, cho mutants affect locomotor parameters, including reduced average speed, direction change, and persistence. Dias analysis of peristaltic waves indicates that mutants exhibit reduced average speed, positive flow and negative flow, and increased stride period. Thus, cho sensilla are major proprioceptive components that underlie touch sensitivity, locomotion, and peristaltic contraction by providing sensory feedback to the locomotor CPG circuit in larvae.},

Here we show that the calcium-independent form of CaMKII has unique effects on larval viability, locomotion, and neuronal excitability in Drosophila. Expression of constitutively active T287D, but not calcium-dependent T287A, mutant CaMKII in Drosophila neurons resulted in decreased viability, behavioral defects, and failure of action potential propagation. The actions of T287D may be mediated, at least in part, by increased potassium conductances. Expression of T287D CaMKII also stimulated an increase in the number of boutons at the larval neuromuscular junction, but did not affect the mechanics of release. This study defines a role for autophosphorylation of CaMKII in the regulation of multiple neuronal functions including the intrinsic properties of neurons.},

Here, by using Drosophila mutants with specific defects in presynaptic function, we found that glutamate receptors clustered normally at neuromuscular junctions of mutants that retained spontaneous transmitter secretion but had lost the ability to release transmitter in response to action potentials. In contrast, receptor clustering was defective in mutants in which both spontaneous and evoked vesicle exocytosis were absent. Thus, spontaneous vesicle exocytosis appears to be tightly linked to the clustering of glutamate receptors during development.},

abstract = {General anesthetics abolish behavioral responsiveness in all animals, and in humans this is accompanied by loss of consciousness. Whether similar target mechanisms and behavioral endpoints exist across species remains controversial, although model organisms have been successfully used to study mechanisms of anesthesia. In Drosophila, a number of key mutants have been characterized as hypersensitive or resistant to general anesthetics by behavioral assays. In order to investigate general anesthesia in the Drosophila brain, local field potential (LFP) recordings were made during incremental exposures to isoflurane in wild-type and mutant flies. As in higher animals, general anesthesia in flies was found to involve a succession of distinct endpoints. At low doses, isoflurane uncoupled brain activity from ongoing movement, followed by a sudden attenuation in neural correlates of perception. Average LFP activity in the brain was more gradually attenuated with higher doses, followed by loss of movement behavior. Among mutants, a strong correspondence was found between behavioral and LFP sensitivities, thereby suggesting that LFP phenotypes are proximal to the anesthetic's mechanism of action. Finally, genetic and pharmacological analysis revealed that anesthetic sensitivities in the fly brain are, like other arousal states, influenced by dopaminergic activity. These results suggest that volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane may target the same processes that sustain wakefulness and attention in the brain. LFP correlates of general anesthesia in Drosophila provide a powerful new approach to uncovering the nature of these processes.},

abstract = {We have designed a system for targeted gene expression that allows the selective activation of any cloned gene in a wide variety of tissue- and cell-specific patterns. The gene encoding the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 is inserted randomly into the Drosophila genome to drive GAL4 expression from one of a diverse array of genomic enhancers. It is then possible to introduce a gene containing GAL4 binding sites within its promoter, to activate it in those cells where GAL4 is expressed, and to observe the effect of this directed misexpression on development. We have used GAL4-directed transcription to expand the domain of embryonic expression of the homeobox protein even-skipped. We show that even-skipped represses wingless and transforms cells that would normally secrete naked cuticle into denticle secreting cells. The GAL4 system can thus be used to study regulatory interactions during embryonic development. In adults, targeted expression can be used to generate dominant phenotypes for use in genetic screens. We have directed expression of an activated form of the Dras2 protein, resulting in dominant eye and wing defects that can be used in screens to identify other members of the Dras2 signal transduction pathway.},

abstract = {Sleep is one of the most noticeable and widespread phenomena occurring in multicellular animals. Nevertheless, no consensus for a theory of its origins has emerged. In particular, no explicit, quantitative theory exists that elucidates or distinguishes between the myriad hypotheses proposed for sleep. Here, we develop a general, quantitative theory for mammalian sleep that relates many of its fundamental parameters to metabolic rate and body size. Several mechanisms suggested for the function of sleep can be placed in this framework, e.g., cellular repair of damage caused by metabolic processes as well as cortical reorganization to process sensory input. Our theory leads to predictions for sleep time, sleep cycle time, and rapid eye movement time as functions of body and brain mass, and it explains, for example, why mice sleep approximately 14 hours per day relative to the 3.5 hours per day that elephants sleep. Data for 96 species of mammals, spanning six orders of magnitude in body size, are consistent with these predictions and provide strong evidence that time scales for sleep are set by the brain's, not the whole-body, metabolic rate.},

It is well known that many physical processes in nature and society display long-range correlations. Hence, in the last few years, considerable research effort has been directed towards studying the distribution of return intervals for long-range correlated time series. Based on numerical simulations, it was shown that the return interval distributions are of stretched exponential type. In this paper, we obtain an analytical expression for the distribution of return intervals in long-range correlated time series which holds good when the average return intervals are large. We show that the distribution is actually a product of power law and a stretched exponential form. We also discuss the regimes of validity and perform detailed studies on how the return interval distribution depends on the threshold used to define extreme events.},

abstract = {Dopaminergic (DA) midbrain neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) are involved in various brain functions such as voluntary movement and reward and are targets in disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. To study the functional properties of identified DA neurons in mouse midbrain slices, we combined patch-clamp recordings with either neurobiotin cell-filling and triple labeling confocal immunohistochemistry, or single-cell RT-PCR. We discriminated four DA subpopulations based on anatomical and neurochemical differences: two calbindin D28-k (CB)-expressing DA populations in the substantia nigra (SN/CB+) or ventral tegmental area (VTA/CB+), and respectively, two calbindin D28-k negative DA populations (SN/CB-, VTA/CB-). VTA/CB+ DA neurons displayed significantly faster pacemaker frequencies with smaller afterhyperpolarizations compared with other DA neurons. In contrast, all four DA populations possessed significant differences in I(h) channel densities and I(h) channel-mediated functional properties like sag amplitudes and rebound delays in the following order: SN/CB- --> VTA/CB- --> SN/CB+ --> VTA/CB+. Single-cell RT-multiplex PCR experiments demonstrated that differential calbindin but not calretinin expression is associated with differential I(h) channel densities. Only in SN/CB- DA neurons, however, I(h) channels were actively involved in pacemaker frequency control. In conclusion, diversity within the DA system is not restricted to distinct axonal projections and differences in synaptic connectivity, but also involves differences in postsynaptic conductances between neurochemically and topographically distinct DA neurons.},

However it is also the very thing that threatens the survival of the (traditional) libraries. That is if libraries will not redefine their roles amidst the emergence of these new tools. Digital institutional repositories (IR) – as a species of digital libraries (Lynch, 2003) – is the opportunity that libraries and librarians can seize to redefine their roles and re-assert their influence in their user communities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDigital libraries are commonly used to manage digital collections that usually generated by vendors (eJournals, eBooks, etc.). Acquisitions, Cataloging, Circulation, and Reference that used to be the domains of librarians are being taken away in digital libraries realm. However there are some functions that vendors and publishers will never take away from libraries, which is the development, management, and use of local content (locally-produced information resources and/or information resources that contain features of local entities). Every community, especially higher education communities, is rich with local contents with their various formats – often in very unconventional manifestations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nBased on experiences gained in developing digital local contents at Desa Infromasi project, it is believed that efforts in identifying, collecting, digitizing, cataloging, and disseminating local content re-affirm the roles of libraries as an entity that establish structure in otherwise chaotic world of myriad information resources. The efforts will also open up avenues for libraries to assume ‘new’ roles as a facilitator of collaborations among different community of users and scholarly communications across disciplines of knowledge (in the context of higher education institutions). All these will in the end help promoting institutional visibility. Besides dealing with digitization, libraries will find themselves exploring a whole new world of outreach that will redefine their roles in their institution and society.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn short, although the chapter will touch on technical aspects of digital libraries, it will focus on the impacts and influence that libraries can assert to their user communities while they are developing and disseminating digital local content using IR. Thus digital libraries should not be viewed as an end. Instead they are great tools for libraries to reinvigorate their roles in their user communities.

These activity patterns can be recorded by optical imaging techniques. However, optical imaging with conventional fluorescence dyes usually does not allow for resolving the activity of biologically defined groups of neurons. Therefore, specifically targeting reporter molecules to neuron populations of common genetic identity is an important goal. We report the use of the genetically encoded calcium-sensitive fluorescence protein cameleon 2.1 [1] in the Drosophila brain. We visualized odorant-evoked intracellular calcium concentration changes in selectively labeled olfactory projection neurons both postsynaptically in the antennal lobe, the primary olfactory neuropil, and presynaptically in the mushroom body calyx, a structure involved in olfactory learning and memory. As a technical achievement, we show that calcium imaging with a genetically encoded fluorescence probe is feasible in a brain in vivo. This will allow one to combine Drosophila's advanced genetic tools with the physiological analysis of brain function. Moreover, we report for the first time optical imaging recordings in synaptic regions of the Drosophila mushroom body calyx and antennal lobe. This provides an important step for the use of Drosophila as a model system in olfaction.},

The analysis of specific cells types in invertebrate models such as molluscs, insects and the medicinal leech provides insight how NO and cyclic nucleotides affect the wiring of nervous systems by regulating cell and growth-cone motility. Inhibition of the NOS and sGC enzymes combined with rescue experiments show that NO signalling orchestrates neurite outgrowth and filopodial dynamics, cell migration of enteric neurons, glial migration and axonogenesis of pioneer fibers. Cultured insect embryos are accessible model systems in which cellular mechanisms of NO-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations can be analyzed in natural settings. Finally, I will outline some indications that NO may also regulate cell motility in the developing and regenerating vertebrate nervous system.},

abstract = {Effects of beta-alanine on mating behavior and aggression were studied in Drosophila melanogaster using the following competitive pairs: (1) homozygous black (b/b) flies, in which beta-alanine synthesis is decreased, vs. alanine is blocked vs. wild-type (e+/e+) flies; (2) dark flies, in which beta-alanine incorporation is reduced, owing mainly to chromosome 3, vs. light flies collected from the same population as were the dark flies; (3) homozygous black (b/b) flies, in which beta-alanine synthesis is decreased, vs. beta-alanine-infected b/b flies, which are phenocopies of wild-type flies. The behavior of mixed-sex groups was studied in a large, illumination-graded observation chamber containing food and in small uniformly illuminated cells also containing food. The relative competitive mating abilities of these types were measured in both experimental conditions. Uninjected black flies, but not injected ones, showed weak and unsteady gait and weak wing extension. In ebony these abnormalities were more extreme. Dark flies did not show these abnormalities. Accelerated sexual maturation was indicated in males by early onset of courtship and enhanced territorial aggression and in females by earliness of mating. Such acceleration was observed in ebony and dark flies, compared with light flies, and among beta-alanine-injected b/b flies competing with uninjected black flies. Ebony males, although maturing earlier than wild-type males, were less successful than wild-type males in mating. This difference was even greater when the flies were all allowed to mature before competing. Ebony females outmated wild-type females. Dark flies outmated light flies, and beta-alanine-injected b/b males outmated uninjected black males, especially in bright light. Ebony flies mated much longer than wild-type flies, and black flies mated slightly longer than injected b/b flies. There was some spatial isolation of ebony from wild type, dark from light, and beta-alanine-injected from uninjected b/b flies in the illumination-graded observation chamber. Ebony flies more than wild type concentrated near food. Flies were attracted to the current of moist inlet air. They were also attracted to deposited excrement, and males defended such deposits as a mating area, thus showing rudiments of arena behavior in which a mating area away from the oviposition site is defended. Usually, however, the defended area focused on food.},

abstract = {Dopamine is found in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues in the larval stage of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and functions as a signaling molecule in the nervous system. Although dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) were previously thought solely to be interneurons, recent studies suggest that dopamine may also act as a neuromodulator in humoral pathways. We examined both application of dopamine on intact larval CNS-segmental preparations and isolated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Dopamine rapidly decreased the rhythmicity of the CNS motor activity. Application of dopamine on neuromuscular preparations of the segmental muscles 6 and 7 resulted in a dose-responsive decrease in the excitatory junction potentials (EJPs). With the use of focal, macro-patch synaptic current recordings the quantal evoked transmission showed a depression of vesicular release at concentrations of 10 microM. Higher concentrations (1 mM) produced a rapid decrement in evoked vesicular release. Dopamine did not alter the shape of the spontaneous synaptic currents, suggesting that dopamine does not alter the postsynaptic muscle fiber receptiveness to the glutaminergic motor nerve transmission. The effects are presynaptic in causing a reduction in the number of vesicles that are stimulated to be released due to neural activity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circadian clocks are biological oscillators that regulate molecular, physiological, and behavioral rhythms in a wide variety of organisms. While behavioral rhythms are typically monitored over many cycles, a similar approach to molecular rhythms was not possible until recently; the advent of real-time analysis using transgenic reporters now permits the observations of molecular rhythms over many cycles as well. This development suggests that new details about the relationship between molecular and behavioral rhythms may be revealed. Even so, behavioral and molecular rhythmicity have been analyzed using different methods, making such comparisons difficult to achieve. To address this shortcoming, among others, we developed a set of integrated analytical tools to unify the analysis of biological rhythms across modalities. RESULTS: We demonstrate an adaptation of digital signal analysis that allows similar treatment of both behavioral and molecular data from our studies of Drosophila. For both types of data, we apply digital filters to extract and clarify details of interest; we employ methods of autocorrelation and spectral analysis to assess rhythmicity and estimate the period; we evaluate phase shifts using crosscorrelation; and we use circular statistics to extract information about phase. CONCLUSION: Using data generated by our investigation of rhythms in Drosophila we demonstrate how a unique aggregation of analytical tools may be used to analyze and compare behavioral and molecular rhythms. These methods are shown to be versatile and will also be adaptable to further experiments, owing in part to the non-proprietary nature of the code we have developed.},

abstract = {Interacting human activities underlie the patterns of many social, technological, and economic phenomena. Here we present clear empirical evidence from Short Message correspondence that observed human actions are the result of the interplay of three basic ingredients: Poisson initiation of tasks and decision making for task execution in individual humans as well as interaction among individuals. This interplay leads to new types of interevent time distribution, neither completely Poisson nor power-law, but a bimodal combination of them. We show that the events can be separated into independent bursts which are generated by frequent mutual interactions in short times following random initiations of communications in longer times by the individuals. We introduce a minimal model of two interacting priority queues incorporating the three basic ingredients which fits well the distributions using the parameters extracted from the empirical data. The model can also embrace a range of realistic social interacting systems such as e-mail and letter communications when taking the time scale of processing into account. Our findings provide insight into various human activities both at the individual and network level. Our analysis and modeling of bimodal activity in human communication from the viewpoint of the interplay between processes of different time scales is likely to shed light on bimodal phenomena in other complex systems, such as interevent times in earthquakes, rainfall, forest fire, and economic systems, etc.},

abstract = {The dynamics of many social, technological and economic phenomena are driven by individual human actions, turning the quantitative understanding of human behavior into a central question of modern science. Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. Here we provide direct evidence that for five human activity patterns, such as email and letter based communications, web browsing, library visits and stock trading, the timing of individual human actions follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. We show that the bursty nature of human behavior is a consequence of a decision based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed, while a few experiencing very long waiting times. In contrast, priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform interevent statistics. We discuss two queuing models that capture human activity. The first model assumes that there are no limitations on the number of tasks an individual can handle at any time, predicting that the waiting time of the individual tasks follow a heavy tailed distribution P(tau(w)) approximately tau(w)(-alpha) with alpha=3/2. The second model imposes limitations on the queue length, resulting in a heavy tailed waiting time distribution characterized by alpha=1. We provide empirical evidence supporting the relevance of these two models to human activity patterns, showing that while emails, web browsing and library visitation display alpha=1, the surface mail based communication belongs to the alpha=3/2 universality class. Finally, we discuss possible extension of the proposed queuing models and outline some future challenges in exploring the statistical mechanics of human dynamics.},

Experimental females did not receive indirect benefits from multiple mating. We conclude that traumatic insemination is probably a coercive male copulatory strategy that results in a sexual conflict of interests.},

abstract = {Monoamines such as dopamine, histamine and serotonin (5-HT) are widely distributed throughout the brain of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, where many of their actions have been investigated. For example, histamine is released from photoreceptor synapses in the lamina neuropile of the visual system. Mutations of the genes white, an important eye pigmentation marker in fly genetics that encodes an ABC transporter, and its binding partner brown, cause neural phenotypes not readily reconciled solely with actions in eye pigmentation. We find that flies mutant for these genes, and another binding partner, scarlet, have about half the wild-type amount of histamine in the head, as well as reduced 5-HT and dopamine. These differences parallel reductions in immunoreactivity to the corresponding biogenic amines. They also correlate with the amine content of fractions after differential centrifugation of head homogenates. Thus, most of the amine is found in the vesicle-rich fraction of wild-type head homogenates, whereas it is found in the supernatant fractions from white, brown and scarlet flies. White co-expresses in lamina epithelial glia with Ebony, which conjugates histamine to beta-alanine. Histamine is then released when the conjugate is hydrolyzed in photoreceptors, by Tan. Mutant white ameliorates the effects of tan on head histamine whereas it exacerbates the effects of ebony. Our results are consistent with the proposal that histamine uptake by the epithelial glia may be white dependent. Behavioral abnormalities in white, brown and scarlet mutants could arise because aminergic neurons in the Drosophila brain have reduced amine for release.},

Activation of a hsp-70/miniwhite (mini-w) transgene in mature males results in a marked change in their sexual behavior such that they begin to vigorously court other mature males. In transformant populations containing equal numbers of both sexes, most males participate, thus forming male-male courtship chains, circles, and lariats. Mutations that ablate the w transgene function also abolish this inducible behavior. Female sexual behavior does not appear to be altered by ectopic w expression. By contrast, when exposed to an active homosexual courtship environment, non-transformant males alter their behavior and actively participate in the male-male chaining. These findings demonstrate that, in Drosophila, both genetic and environmental factors play a role in male sexual behavior.},

abstract = {We report functional neuronal and synaptic transmission properties in Drosophila CNS neurons. Whole cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings were made from dorsally positioned neurons in the larval ventral nerve cord. Comparison of neuronal Green Fluorescent Protein markers and intracellular dye labeling revealed that recorded cells consisted primarily of identified motor neurons. Neurons had resting potentials of -50 to -60 mV and fired repetitive action potentials (APs) in response to depolarizing current injection. Acetylcholine application elicited large excitatory responses and AP bursts that were reversibly blocked by the nicotinic receptor antagonist D-tubocurarine (dtC). GABA and glutamate application elicited similar inhibitory responses that reversed near normal resting potential and were reversibly blocked by the chloride channel blocker picrotoxin. Multiple types of endogenous synaptically driven activity were present in most neurons, including fast spontaneous synaptic events resembling unitary excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and sustained excitatory currents and potentials. Sustained forms of endogenous activity ranged in amplitude from smaller subthreshold "intermediate" sustained events to large "rhythmic" events that supported bursts of APs. Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves or focal stimulation of the neuropil evoked sustained responses and fast EPSCs similar to endogenous events. Endogenous activity and evoked responses required external Ca(2+) and were reversibly blocked by dtC application, indicating that cholinergic synaptic transmission directly underlies observed activity. Synaptic current amplitude and frequency were reduced in shibire conditional dynamin mutants and increased in dunce cAMP phosphodiesterase mutants. These results complement and advance those of recent functional studies in Drosophila embryonic neurons and demonstrate the feasibility of in-depth synaptic transmission and plasticity studies in the Drosophila CNS.},

abstract = {I(f), a diastolic depolarizing current activated by hyperpolarization, is a key player in cardiac pacing. Despite the fact that I(f) has been known for over 20 years, the encoding genes, namely HCN1 to 4, have only recently been identified. Functional data imply that different HCN isoforms may coassemble to form heteromeric channel complexes, but little direct evidence is available. Subunit stoichiometry is also unknown. Although the pore region of HCN channels contains the glycine-tyrosine-glycine (GYG) signature motif found in K+-selective channels, they permeate both Na+ and K+. In the present study, we probed the functional importance of the GYG selectivity motif in pacemaker channels by replacing this triplet in HCN1 with alanines (GYG(349-351)AAA or HCN1-AAA). HCN1-AAA did not yield functional currents; coexpression of HCN1-AAA with wild-type (WT) HCN1 suppressed normal channel activity in a dominant-negative manner (55.2+/-3.2\%, 68.3+/-4.3\%, 78.7+/-1.6\%, 91.7+/-0.8\%, and 97.9+/-0.2\% current reduction at -140 mV for WT:AAA cRNA ratios of 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2, respectively) without affecting gating (steady-state activation, activation and deactivation kinetics) or permeation (reversal potential) properties. HCN1-AAA coexpression, however, did not alter the expressed current amplitudes of Kv1.4 and Kv2.1 channels, indicating that its suppressive effect was channel-specific. Statistical analysis reveals that a single HCN channel is composed of 4 monomeric subunits. Interestingly, HCN1-AAA also inhibited HCN2 in a dominant-negative manner with the same efficacy. We conclude that the GYG motif is a critical determinant of ion permeation for HCN channels, and that HCN1 and HCN2 readily coassemble to form heterotetrameric complexes.},

abstract = {The hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) is widely distributed in excitable cells. Ih plays important roles in regulation of cellular excitability, rhythmic activity, and synaptic function. We previously showed that, in pyloric dilator (PD) neurons of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of spiny lobsters, Ih can be endogenously upregulated to compensate for artificial overexpression of the Shal transient potassium channel; this maintains normal firing properties of the neuron despite large increases in potassium current. To further explore the function of Ih in the pyloric network, we injected cRNA of PAIH, a lobster gene that encodes Ih, into rhythmically active PD neurons. Overexpression of PAIH produced a fourfold increase in Ih, although with somewhat different biophysical properties than the endogenous current. Compared with the endogenous Ih, the voltage for half-maximal activation of the PAIH-evoked current was depolarized by 10 mV, and its activation kinetics were significantly faster. This increase in Ih did not affect the expression of IA or other outward currents. Instead, it significantly altered the firing properties of the PD neurons. Increased Ih depolarized the minimum membrane potential of the cell, reduced the oscillation amplitude, decreased the time to the first spike, and increased the duty cycle and number of action potentials per burst. We used both dynamic-clamp experiments, injecting the modeled PAIH currents into PD cells in a functioning STG, and a theoretical model of a two-cell network to demonstrate that the increased Ih was sufficient to cause the observed changes in the PD activity.},

abstract = {Members of the HCN channel family generate hyperpolarization-activated cation currents (Ih) that are directly regulated by cAMP and contribute to pacemaker activity in heart and brain. The four HCN isoforms show distinct but overlapping patterns of expression in different tissues. Here, we report that HCN1 and HCN2, isoforms coexpressed in neocortex and hippocampus that differ markedly in their biophysical properties, coassemble to generate heteromultimeric channels with novel properties. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, HCN1 channels activate 5-10-fold more rapidly than HCN2 channels. HCN1 channels also activate at voltages that are 10-20 mV more positive than those required to activate HCN2. In cell-free patches, the steady-state activation curve of HCN1 channels shows a minimal shift in response to cAMP (+4 mV), whereas that of HCN2 channels shows a pronounced shift (+17 mV). Coexpression of HCN1 and HCN2 yields Ih currents that activate with kinetics and a voltage dependence that tend to be intermediate between those of HCN1 and HCN2 homomers, although the coexpressed channels do show a relatively large shift by cAMP (+14 mV). Neither the kinetics, steady-state voltage dependence, nor cAMP dose-response curve for the coexpressed Ih can be reproduced by the linear sum of independent populations of HCN1 and HCN2 homomers. These results are most simply explained by the formation of heteromeric channels with novel properties. The properties of these heteromeric channels closely resemble the properties of I(h) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, cells that coexpress HCN1 and HCN2. Finally, differences in Ih channel properties recorded in cell-free patches versus intact oocytes are shown to be due, in part, to modulation of Ih by basal levels of cAMP in intact cells.},

Imp13 is expressed in and around nuclei of both neurons and muscles. At the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), imp13 affects muscle growth and formation of the subsynaptic reticulum without influencing any presynaptic structural features. In the absence of imp13, the probability of release of neurotransmitter and quantal content is increased, yet the abundance of the postsynaptic receptors and the amplitude of miniature excitatory junctional potentials are not affected. Interestingly, imp13 is required in the muscles to control presynaptic release. Thus, imp13 is a novel factor that affects neurotransmitter release at the fly NMJ. Its role in the context of synaptic homeostasis is discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Extended wakefulness disrupts acquisition of short-term memories in mammals. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms triggered by extended waking and restored by sleep are unknown. Moreover, the neuronal circuits that depend on sleep for optimal learning remain unidentified. Results: Learning was evaluated with aversive phototaxic suppression. In this task, flies learn to avoid light that is paired with an aversive stimulus (quinine-humidity). We demonstrate extensive homology in sleep-deprivation-induced learning impairment between flies and humans. Both 6 hr and 12 hr of sleep deprivation are sufficient to impair learning in Canton-S (Cs) flies. Moreover, learning is impaired at the end of the normal waking day in direct correlation with time spent awake. Mechanistic studies indicate that this task requires intact mushroom bodies (MBs) and requires the dopamine D1-like receptor (dDA1). Importantly, sleep-deprivation-induced learning impairments could be rescued by targeted gene expression of the dDA1 receptor to the MBs. Conclusions: These data provide direct evidence that extended wakefulness disrupts learning in Drosophila. These results demonstrate that it is possible to prevent the effects of sleep deprivation by targeting a single neuronal structure and identify cellular and molecular targets adversely affected by extended waking in a genetically tractable model organism. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Much of our understanding of synaptogenesis comes from studies that deal with the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Although well studied, it is not clear how far the NMJ represents an adequate model for the formation of synapses within the CNS. Here we investigate the role of Fasciclin II (Fas II) in the development of synapses between identified motor neurons and cholinergic interneurons in the CNS of Drosophila. Fas II is a neural cell adhesion molecule homolog that is involved in both target selection and synaptic plasticity at the NMJ in Drosophila. In this study, we show that levels of Fas II are critical determinants of synapse formation and growth in the CNS. The initial establishment of synaptic contacts between these identified neurons is seemingly independent of Fas II. The subsequent proliferation of these synaptic connections that occurs postembryonically is, in contrast, significantly retarded by the absence of Fas II. Although the initial formation of synaptic connectivity between these neurons is seemingly independent of Fas II, we show that their formation is, nevertheless, significantly affected by manipulations that alter the relative balance of Fas II in the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Increasing expression of Fas II in either the presynaptic or postsynaptic neurons, during embryogenesis, is sufficient to disrupt the normal level of synaptic connectivity that occurs between these neurons. This effect of Fas II is isoform specific and, moreover, phenocopies the disruption to synaptic connectivity observed previously after tetanus toxin light chain-dependent blockade of evoked synaptic vesicle release in these neurons.},

abstract = {Adult behavioral assays have been used with great success in Drosophila melanogaster to identify circadian rhythm genes. In particular, the locomotor activity assay can identify altered behavior patterns over the course of several days in small populations, or even individual flies. Sleep is a highly conserved behavior that is required for optimal performance and, in many cases, life of an organism. Drosophila demonstrate a behavioral state that shows traits consistent with sleep: periods of relative behavioral immobility that coincide with an increased arousal threshold after \~{}5 min of inactivity, regulated by circadian and homeostatic mechanisms. However, because flies do not produce brain waves recordable by electroencephalography, sleep researchers use behavior-based paradigms to infer when a fly is asleep, as opposed to awake but immobile. Data on Drosophila activity can be collected using an automated monitoring system to provide insight into sleep duration, consolidation, and latency, as well as sleep deprivation and rebound. This protocol details the use of Counting Macro, an Excel-based program, to process data created with the Drosophila Activity Monitoring (DAM) System from TriKinetics for sleep analyses. Specifically, it details the steps necessary to convert the raw data created by the DAM System into sleep duration and consolidation data, broken down into the light (L), dark (D), light:dark cycling (LD), and constant darkness (DD) phases of a behavior experiment.},

abstract = {The timing of many animal behaviors are characterized by bursts of activity separated by long periods of inactivity. Bursty dynamics is widespread (1-6), but only recently has there been a modeling effort to understand its origin from a behavioral point of view (7,8). In the proposed model, behavioral bursts are the consequence of an internal decision-making process, where tasks are executed according to a queued priority list. In this study we have experimentally examined this link in Drosophila melanogaster, by using targeted mutations of structures known to disrupt decision-making (9). To characterize burstiness, we found that the distribution of intervals between activity bouts of wild-type Drosophila are well described by the Weibull distribution, a common distribution of bursty dynamics in complex systems. The Weibull shape (k) parameter can thus be used to quantify and compare burstiness between different genotypes and/or conditions. In addition, we show that the bursty dynamics is mainly determined by the inter-activity distribution and not by memory effects, similarly to human dynamics (5). To examine the connection between decision-making circuit and behavioral burstiness, we altered dopaminergic signaling or selectively silenced parts of the mushroom body (9), and found that the flies inherent burstiness changes, a result consistent with the proposed model. 1.

Other hypothalamic neurons stabilize the switch, and their absence results in inappropriate switching of behavioural states, such as occurs in narcolepsy.

Fertilisation is external and the rapid growth of the transparent embryo, including development of internal organs, can be observed easily making it well suited for imaging studies.

Such a simple picture imposes constraints on interpreting the diverse behavioral and computational properties that mushroom bodies are supposed to perform. Using a P[GAL4] enhancer-trap approach, we have revealed axonal processes corresponding to intrinsic cells of the Drosophila mushroom bodies. Rather than being homogenous, we find the Drosophila mushroom bodies to be compound neuropils in which parallel subcomponents exhibit discrete patterns of gene expression. Different patterns correspond to hitherto unobserved differences in Kenyon cell trajectory and placement. On the basis of this unexpected complexity, we propose a model for mushroom body function in which parallel channels of information flow, perhaps with different computational properties, subserve different behavioral roles.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drosophila larval locomotion consists of forward peristalsis interrupted by episodes of pausing, turning and exploratory behavior (head swinging). This behavior can be regulated by visual input as seen by light-induced increase in pausing, head swinging and direction change as well as reduction of linear speed that characterizes the larval photophobic response. During 3rd instar stage, Drosophila larvae gradually cease to be repelled by light and are photoneutral by the time they wander in search for a place to undergo metamorphosis. Thus, Drosophila larval photobehavior can be used to study control of locomotion. RESULTS: We used targeted neuronal silencing to assess the role of candidate neurons in the regulation of larval photobehavior. Inactivation of DOPA decarboxylase (Ddc) neurons increases the response to light throughout larval development, including during the later stages of the 3rd instar characterized by photoneutral response. Increased response to light is characterized by increase in light-induced direction change and associated pause, and reduction of linear movement. Amongst Ddc neurons, suppression of the activity of corazonergic and serotonergic but not dopaminergic neurons increases the photophobic response observed during 3rd instar stage. Silencing of serotonergic neurons does not disrupt larval locomotion or the response to mechanical stimuli. Reduced serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) signaling within serotonergic neurons recapitulates the results obtained with targeted neuronal silencing. Ablation of serotonergic cells in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) does not affect the larval response to light. Similarly, disruption of serotonergic projections that contact the photoreceptor termini in the brain hemispheres does not impact the larval response to light. Finally, pan-neural over-expression of 5-HT1A Dro receptors, but not of any other 5-HT receptor subtype, causes a significant decrease in the response to light of 3rd instar larvae. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that activity of serotonergic and corazonergic neurons contribute to the control of larval locomotion by light. We conclude that this control is carried out by 5-HT neurons located in the brain hemispheres, but does not appear to occur at the photoreceptor level and may be mediated by 5-HT1A Dro receptors. These findings provide new insights into the function of 5-HT neurons in Drosophila larval behavior as well as into the mechanisms underlying regulation of larval response to light.},

@article{Wang1997a,
abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) and natriuretic peptide hormones play key roles in a surprising number of neuronal functions, including learning and memory. Most data suggest that they exert converging actions by elevation of intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels through activation of soluble and particulate guanylyl cyclases. However, cGMP is only the starting point for multiple signaling cascades, which are now beginning to be defined. A primary action of elevated cGMP levels is the stimulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), the major intracellular receptor protein for cGMP, which phosphorylates substrate proteins to exert its actions. It has become increasingly clear that PKG mediates some of the neuronal effects of cGMP, but how is not yet clear. One clear illustration of this pathway has been reported in striatonigral nerve terminals, where NO mediates phosphorylation of the protein phosphatase regulator dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein having a molecular mass of 32,000 (DARPP-32) by PKG. There are remarkably few PKG substrates in brain whose identities are known. A survey of these proteins and those known from other tissues that might also be found in the nervous system reveals the key molecular sites where cGMP and PKG signaling is likely to be regulating neural function. These potential substrates are critically placed to have profound effects on the protein phosphorylation network through regulation of protein phosphatases, intracellular calcium levels, and the function of many ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. The brain also contains a rich diversity of specific PKG substrates whose identities are not yet known. Their future identification will provide exciting new leads that will permit better understanding of the role of PKG signaling in both basic and higher orders of brain function.},

abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are used extensively in sleep research; both to further understanding of sleep in general and also as a model of human sleep. To date, sleep studies have been performed in larval and adult zebrafish but no efforts have been made to document the ontogeny of zebrafish sleep-wake cycles. Because sleep differs across phylogeny and ontogeny it is important to validate the use of zebrafish in elucidating the neural substrates of sleep. Here we describe the development of sleep and wake across the zebrafish lifespan and how it compares to humans. We find power-law distributions to best fit wake bout data but demonstrate that exponential distributions, previously used to describe sleep bout distributions, fail to adequately account for the data in either species. Regardless, the data reveal remarkable similarities in the ontogeny of sleep cycles in zebrafish and humans. Moreover, as seen in other organisms, zebrafish sleep levels are highest early in ontogeny and sleep and wake bouts gradually consolidate to form the adult sleep pattern. Finally, sleep percentage, bout duration, bout number, and sleep fragmentation are shown to allow for meaningful comparisons between zebrafish and human sleep.},

However, the specific actions of dopamine depend on the dopamine receptor type that is expressed in the target cell. As in mammals, different subtypes of dopamine receptors have been cloned and characterized from invertebrates, and these receptor subtypes have different structural and functional properties. Understanding how these receptors respond to dopamine and in which cells each receptor type is expressed is key to our understanding of the role of dopamine signaling. Comparison of the amino acid sequences and experimentally determined functional properties suggest that there are at least three distinct types of dopamine receptors in invertebrates. This review focuses on invertebrate dopamine receptors for which the genes have been isolated and identified, and examines our current knowledge of the functional and structural properties of these receptors, and their pharmacology and expression.},

This paper provides a review of the important literature to present recent advances in our understanding of how gustatory and olfactory stimuli are perceived. An overview is given of the experimental procedures currently used to characterize the fly chemosensory behaviour. Since this species provides extremely useful genetic tools, a focus is made on those allowing to manipulate behaviour, and hence to understand its molecular and cellular bases. Such tools include single-gene mutants and the Gal4/UAS system. They can be combined with studies of the natural polymorphism of behavioural responses. Recent data obtained with these various approaches unravel some important aspects of taste and olfaction. These appear as rather complex processes, as revealed by results showing dose-dependence, plasticity and sexual dimorphism. Taken together, these results and the available tools open interesting perspectives for the years to come, in our attempts to make the link between genes and behaviour. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {While current studies on complex networks focus on systems that change relatively slowly in time, the structure of the most visited regions of the web is altered at the time scale from hours to days. Here we investigate the dynamics of visitation of a major news portal, representing the prototype for such a rapidly evolving network. The nodes of the network can be classified into stable nodes, which form the time-independent skeleton of the portal, and news documents. The visitations of the two node classes are markedly different, the skeleton acquiring visits at a constant rate, while a news document's visitation peaks after a few hours. We find that the visitation pattern of a news document decays as a power law, in contrast with the exponential prediction provided by simple models of site visitation. This is rooted in the inhomogeneous nature of the browsing pattern characterizing individual users: the time interval between consecutive visits by the same user to the site follows a power-law distribution, in contrast to the exponential expected for Poisson processes. We show that the exponent characterizing the individual user's browsing patterns determines the power-law decay in a document's visitation. Finally, our results document the fleeting quality of news and events: while fifteen minutes of fame is still an exaggeration in the online media, we find that access to most news items significantly decays after 36 hours of posting.},

@article{Shaikh2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder and its pathophysiology is unknown. We hypothesize that increased membrane excitability in motor circuits has a key role in the pathogenesis of ET. Specifically, we propose that neural circuits controlling ballistic movements are inherently unstable due to their underlying reciprocal innervation. Such instability is enhanced by increased neural membrane excitability and the circuit begins to oscillate. These oscillations manifest as tremor. METHODS: Postural limb tremor was recorded in 22 ET patients and then the phenotype was simulated with a conductance-based neuromimetic model of ballistic movements. The model neuron was Hodgkin-Huxley type with added hyperpolarization activated cation current (Ih), low threshold calcium current (IT), and GABA and glycine mediated chloride currents. The neurons also featured the neurophysiological property of rebound excitation after release from sustained inhibition (post-inhibitory rebound). The model featured a reciprocally innervated circuit of neurons that project to agonist and antagonist muscle pairs. RESULTS: Neural excitability was modulated by changing Ih and/or IT. Increasing Ih and/or IT further depolarized the membrane and thus increased excitability. The characteristics of the tremor from all ET patients were simulated when Ih was increased to approximately 10x the range of physiological values. In contrast, increasing other membrane conductances, while keeping Ih at a physiological value, did not simulate the tremor. Increases in Ih and IT determined the frequency and amplitude of the simulated oscillations. CONCLUSION: These simulations support the hypothesis that increased membrane excitability in potentially unstable, reciprocally innervated circuits can produce oscillations that resemble ET. Neural excitability could be increased in a number of ways. In this study membrane excitability was increased by up-regulating Ih and IT. This approach suggests new experimental and clinical ways to understand and treat common tremor disorders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circadian clocks are biological oscillators that regulate molecular, physiological, and behavioral rhythms in a wide variety of organisms. While behavioral rhythms are typically monitored over many cycles, a similar approach to molecular rhythms was not possible until recently; the advent of real-time analysis using transgenic reporters now permits the observations of molecular rhythms over many cycles as well. This development suggests that new details about the relationship between molecular and behavioral rhythms may be revealed. Even so, behavioral and molecular rhythmicity have been analyzed using different methods, making such comparisons difficult to achieve. To address this shortcoming, among others, we developed a set of integrated analytical tools to unify the analysis of biological rhythms across modalities. RESULTS: We demonstrate an adaptation of digital signal analysis that allows similar treatment of both behavioral and molecular data from our studies of Drosophila. For both types of data, we apply digital filters to extract and clarify details of interest; we employ methods of autocorrelation and spectral analysis to assess rhythmicity and estimate the period; we evaluate phase shifts using crosscorrelation; and we use circular statistics to extract information about phase. CONCLUSION: Using data generated by our investigation of rhythms in Drosophila we demonstrate how a unique aggregation of analytical tools may be used to analyze and compare behavioral and molecular rhythms. These methods are shown to be versatile and will also be adaptable to further experiments, owing in part to the non-proprietary nature of the code we have developed.},

abstract = {To make good decisions, we evaluate past choices to guide later decisions. In most situations, we have the opportunity to simultaneously learn about both the consequences of our choice (i.e., operantly) and the stimuli associated with correct or incorrect choices (i.e., classically) [1]. Interestingly, in many species, including humans, these learning processes occasionally lead to irrational decisions [2]. An extreme case is the habitual drug user consistently administering the drug despite the negative consequences, but we all have experience with our own, less severe habits. The standard animal model employs a combination of operant and classical learning components to bring about habit formation in rodents [3, 4]. After extended training, these animals will press a lever even if the outcome associated with lever-pressing is no longer desired [5]. In this study, experiments with wild-type and transgenic flies revealed that a prominent insect neuropil, the mushroom bodies (MBs), regulates habit formation in flies by inhibiting the operant learning system when a predictive stimulus is present. This inhibition enables generalization of the classical memory and prevents premature habit formation. Extended training in wild-type flies produced a phenocopy of MB-impaired flies, such that generalization was abolished and goal-directed actions were transformed into habitual responses. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In mammals, dopamine 2-like receptors are expressed in distinct pathways within the central nervous system, as well as in peripheral tissues. Selected neuronal D2-like receptors play a critical role in modulating locomotor activity and, as such, represent an important therapeutic target (e.g. in Parkinson's disease). Previous studies have established that proteins required for dopamine (DA) neurotransmission are highly conserved between mammals and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. These include a fly dopamine 2-like receptor (DD2R; Hearn et al. PNAS 2002 99(22):14554) that has structural and pharmacologic similarity to the human D2-like (D2R). In the current study, we define the spatial expression pattern of DD2R, and functionally characterize flies with reduced DD2 receptor levels. We show that DD2R is expressed in the larval and adult nervous systems, in cell groups that include the Ap-let cohort of peptidergic neurons, as well as in peripheral tissues including the gut and Malpighian tubules. To examine DD2R function in vivo, we generated RNA-interference (RNAi) flies with reduced DD2R expression. Behavioral analysis revealed that these flies show significantly decreased locomotor activity, similar to the phenotype observed in mammals with reduced D2R expression. The fly RNAi phenotype can be rescued by administration of the DD2R synthetic agonist bromocriptine, indicating specificity for the RNAi effect. These results suggest Drosophila as a useful system for future studies aimed at identifying modifiers of dopaminergic signaling/locomotor function.},

abstract = {Genetic variation in the gene foraging (for) is associated with a natural behavioral dimorphism in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Some larvae, called 'rovers', have increased foraging locomotion compared to others, called 'sitters', and this difference is directly related to for-encoded cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activity. Here we report that larvae with mutations in the gene dgcalpha1, which encodes a soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) subunit, have increases in both PKG activity and foraging locomotion. This is contrary to our original prediction that, based on the role of sGC in the synthesis of cGMP, dgcalpha1 mutant larvae would have deficient cGMP production leading to decreased PKG activation and thus reduced larval foraging locomotion. We performed DNA microarray analyses to compare transcriptional changes induced by a dgcalpha1 mutation in both rover and sitter wildtype genetic backgrounds. In either background, we identified many genes that are differentially transcribed, and interestingly, relatively few are affected in both backgrounds. Furthermore, several of these commonly affected genes are enhanced or suppressed in a background-dependent manner. Thus, genetic background has a critical influence on the molecular effects of this mutation. These findings will support future investigations of Drosophila foraging behavior.},

The dynamic interplay of both processes contributes to the expression of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Here, we exploited various facets of short-term plasticity at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction to dissect these two processes. This enabled us to rigorously analyze different models of synaptic vesicle pools in terms of their size and mobilization properties. Independent of the specific model, we estimate approximately 300 readily releasable vesicles with an average release probability of approximately 50\% in 1 mM extracellular calcium ( approximately 5\% in 0.4 mM extracellular calcium) under resting conditions. The models also helped interpreting the altered short-term plasticity of the previously reported mutant of the active zone component Bruchpilot (BRP). Finally, our results were independently confirmed through fluctuation analysis.

abstract = {Olfactory learning assays in Drosophila have revealed that distinct brain structures known as mushroom bodies (MBs) are critical for the associative learning and memory of olfactory stimuli. However, the precise roles of the different neurons comprising the MBs are still under debate. The confusion surrounding the roles of the different neurons may be due, in part, to the use of different odors as conditioned stimuli in previous studies. We investigated the requirements for the different MB neurons, specifically the $\alpha$/$\beta$ versus the $\gamma$ neurons, and whether olfactory learning is supported by different subsets of MB neurons irrespective of the odors used as conditioned stimuli. We expressed the rutabaga (rut)-encoded adenylyl cyclase in either the $\gamma$ or $\alpha$/$\beta$ neurons and examined the effects on restoring olfactory associative learning and memory of rut mutant flies. We also expressed a temperature-sensitive shibire (shi) transgene in these neuron sets and examined the effects of disrupting synaptic vesicle recycling on Drosophila olfactory learning. Our results indicate that although we did not detect odor-pair-specific learning using GAL4 drivers that primarily express in $\gamma$ neurons, expression of the transgenes in a subset of $\alpha$/$\beta$ neurons resulted in both odor-pair-specific rescue of the rut defect as well as odor-pair-specific disruption of learning using shits1.},

abstract = {Dopamine is found in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues in the larval stage of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and functions as a signaling molecule in the nervous system. Although dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) were previously thought solely to be interneurons, recent studies suggest that dopamine may also act as a neuromodulator in humoral pathways. We examined both application of dopamine on intact larval CNS-segmental preparations and isolated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Dopamine rapidly decreased the rhythmicity of the CNS motor activity. Application of dopamine on neuromuscular preparations of the segmental muscles 6 and 7 resulted in a dose-responsive decrease in the excitatory junction potentials (EJPs). With the use of focal, macro-patch synaptic current recordings the quantal evoked transmission showed a depression of vesicular release at concentrations of 10 microM. Higher concentrations (1 mM) produced a rapid decrement in evoked vesicular release. Dopamine did not alter the shape of the spontaneous synaptic currents, suggesting that dopamine does not alter the postsynaptic muscle fiber receptiveness to the glutaminergic motor nerve transmission. The effects are presynaptic in causing a reduction in the number of vesicles that are stimulated to be released due to neural activity.},

abstract = {This paper presents a detailed characterisation of locomotor behaviour of a single Drosophila fly freely walking in a small square arena. Locomotor activity is monitored by a video-tracking paradigm. Multiple parameters are extracted to construct the portrait of locomotor activity: the total distance moved, the number of episodes of activity and inactivity, the duration of activity, and the mean walking speed. To initiate a quantification of the fly's spatial walking movements, the number of passages in a virtual centre zone has also been determined. Moreover, to reveal the trajectory, as an index of fly's navigation ability, the turning angle, the angular velocity and the meander have been measured. Finally, we show that the number of episodes of inactivity as function of their duration follows a power law, while its counterpart, the episodes of activity does not, suggesting that the overall pattern of locomotor activity adheres to a fractal-like structure. Remarkably, the majority of these parameters are sexually dimorphic. This fine description of locomotor activity represents a new tool which will facilitate the study of the role of the different brain structures in the organisation of locomotor activity and the localisation of the fly's central pattern generator for locomotion and its motivational control. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

At brp mutant active zones, electron-dense projections (T-bars) were entirely lost, Ca2+ channels were reduced in density, evoked vesicle release was depressed, and short-term plasticity was altered.

We have established the physiological and patterning functions of HSPGs at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction by using mutations that block heparan sulfate synthesis or sulfation to compromise HSPG function. The mutant animals showed defects in synaptic physiology and morphology suggesting that HSPGs function both presynaptically and postsynaptically; these defects could be rescued by appropriate transgene expression. Of particular interest were selective disruptions of mitochondrial localization, abnormal distributions of Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum markers in the muscle, and a markedly increased level of stimulus-dependent endocytosis in the motoneuron. Our data support the emerging view that HSPG functions are not limited to the cell surface and matrix environments, but also affect a diverse set of cellular processes including membrane trafficking and organelle distributions.},

We develop and study the properties of neural models with scale-invariant, power-law adaptation and contrast them with the more commonly studied exponential case. Responses of an adapting firing-rate model to constant, pulsed, and oscillating inputs in both the power-law and exponential cases are considered. We construct a spiking model with power-law adaptation based on a nested cascade of processes and show that it can be "programmed" to produce a wide range of time delays. Finally, within a network model, we use power-law adaptation to reproduce long-term features of the tilt aftereffect.},

abstract = {Brains are usually described as input/output systems: they transform sensory input into motor output. However, the motor output of brains (behavior) is notoriously variable, even under identical sensory conditions. The question of whether this behavioral variability merely reflects residual deviations due to extrinsic random noise in such otherwise deterministic systems or an intrinsic, adaptive indeterminacy trait is central for the basic understanding of brain function. Instead of random noise, we find a fractal order (resembling L\'{e}vy flights) in the temporal structure of spontaneous flight maneuvers in tethered Drosophila fruit flies. L\'{e}vy-like probabilistic behavior patterns are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting a general neural mechanism underlying spontaneous behavior. Drosophila can produce these patterns endogenously, without any external cues. The fly's behavior is controlled by brain circuits which operate as a nonlinear system with unstable dynamics far from equilibrium. These findings suggest that both general models of brain function and autonomous agents ought to include biologically relevant nonlinear, endogenous behavior-initiating mechanisms if they strive to realistically simulate biological brains or out-compete other agents.},

abstract = {The roles of cells within the nervous system are based on their properties of excitability, which are in part governed by voltage-gated ion channels. HCN channels underlie the hyperpolarization-activated current, Ih, an important regulator of excitability and rhythmicity through control of basic membrane properties. Ih is present in multiple neuronal types and regions of the central nervous system, and changes in Ih alter cellular input-output properties and neuronal circuitry important for behavior such as learning and memory. Furthermore, the pathophysiology of neurological diseases of both the central and peripheral nervous system involves defects in excitability, rhythmicity, and signaling, and animal models of many of these disorders have implicated changes in HCN channels and Ih as critical for pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on recent research elucidating the role of HCN channels and Ih in behavior and disease. These studies have utilized knockout mice as well as animal models of disease to examine how Ih may be important in regulating learning and memory, sleep, and consciousness, as well as how misregulation of Ih may contribute to epilepsy, chronic pain, and other neurological disorders. This review will help guide future studies aimed at further understanding the function of this unique conductance in both health and disease of the mammalian brain. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In vivo stimulation of a relatively "silent" phasic crayfish motoneuron changes the ultrastructure of its synaptic terminals to a more tonic phenotype. The closer muscle of the crayfish claw is supplied by only 2 excitatory motoneurons, one of which is phasic and the other tonic. The ultrastructures of conditioned phasic, unconditioned phasic, and tonic motor terminals were compared. The terminals of the tonic motor axon were larger in cross-sectional area, had larger mitochondria, greater synaptic contact area, and were more varicose than unconditioned phasic terminals. Following long-term tonic stimulation of the phasic axon, its terminals became more varicose, mitochondrial cross-sectional area more than doubled, and synapses and mitochondria came into closer proximity, although mean terminal cross-sectional area did not change. Thus, the conditioned phasic terminals became more similar to those of the tonic motor axon. These changes in ultrastructure correlate with, and may be causally linked to, previously reported changes in neuromuscular synaptic physiology produced by in vivo tonic stimulation of this motoneuron. We conclude that the ongoing level of impulse activity can affect the ultrastructural differentiation of synaptic terminals and synapses of the phasic motoneuron.},

abstract = {In recent years evidence has been accumulating that personalities are not only found in humans but also in a wide range of other animal species. Individuals differ consistently in their behavioural tendencies and the behaviour in one context is correlated with the behaviour in multiple other contexts. From an adaptive perspective, the evolution of animal personalities is still a mystery, because a more flexible structure of behaviour should provide a selective advantage. Accordingly, many researchers view personalities as resulting from constraints imposed by the architecture of behaviour (but see ref. 12). In contrast, we show here that animal personalities can be given an adaptive explanation. Our argument is based on the insight that the trade-off between current and future reproduction often results in polymorphic populations in which some individuals put more emphasis on future fitness returns than others. Life-history theory predicts that such differences in fitness expectations should result in systematic differences in risk-taking behaviour. Individuals with high future expectations (who have much to lose) should be more risk-averse than individuals with low expectations. This applies to all kinds of risky situations, so individuals should consistently differ in their behaviour. By means of an evolutionary model we demonstrate that this basic principle results in the evolution of animal personalities. It simultaneously explains the coexistence of behavioural types, the consistency of behaviour through time and the structure of behavioural correlations across contexts. Moreover, it explains the common finding that explorative behaviour and risk-related traits like boldness and aggressiveness are common characteristics of animal personalities.},

abstract = {Dopaminergic (DA) midbrain neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) are involved in various brain functions such as voluntary movement and reward and are targets in disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. To study the functional properties of identified DA neurons in mouse midbrain slices, we combined patch-clamp recordings with either neurobiotin cell-filling and triple labeling confocal immunohistochemistry, or single-cell RT-PCR. We discriminated four DA subpopulations based on anatomical and neurochemical differences: two calbindin D28-k (CB)-expressing DA populations in the substantia nigra (SN/CB+) or ventral tegmental area (VTA/CB+), and respectively, two calbindin D28-k negative DA populations (SN/CB-, VTA/CB-). VTA/CB+ DA neurons displayed significantly faster pacemaker frequencies with smaller afterhyperpolarizations compared with other DA neurons. In contrast, all four DA populations possessed significant differences in I(h) channel densities and I(h) channel-mediated functional properties like sag amplitudes and rebound delays in the following order: SN/CB- --> VTA/CB- --> SN/CB+ --> VTA/CB+. Single-cell RT-multiplex PCR experiments demonstrated that differential calbindin but not calretinin expression is associated with differential I(h) channel densities. Only in SN/CB- DA neurons, however, I(h) channels were actively involved in pacemaker frequency control. In conclusion, diversity within the DA system is not restricted to distinct axonal projections and differences in synaptic connectivity, but also involves differences in postsynaptic conductances between neurochemically and topographically distinct DA neurons.},

Using specific promoters and targeting signals, the probes are introduced into an intact organism and directed to specific tissue regions, cell types, and subcellular compartments, thereby extracting specific signals more efficiently and in a more relevant physiological context than before. Optical imaging using genetically encoded probes has enabled us to decipher spatio-temporal information coded in complex tissues.},

abstract = {Dopaminergic neurons are thought to drive learning by signaling changes in the expectations of salient events, such as rewards or punishments. Olfactory conditioning in Drosophila requires direct dopamine action on intrinsic mushroom body neurons, the likely storage sites of olfactory memories. Neither the cellular sources of the conditioning dopamine nor its precise postsynaptic targets are known. By optically controlling genetically circumscribed subsets of dopaminergic neurons in the behaving fly, we have mapped the origin of aversive reinforcement signals to the PPL1 cluster of 12 dopaminergic cells. PPL1 projections target restricted domains in the vertical lobes and heel of the mushroom body. Artificially evoked activity in a small number of identifiable cells thus suffices for programming behaviorally meaningful memories. The delineation of core reinforcement circuitry is an essential first step in dissecting the neural mechanisms that compute and represent valuations, store associations, and guide actions. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Studies with mammalian models have identified molecular targets, neurochemical systems, and brain regions that mediate some of the addictive properties of abused drugs. Yet, our understanding of how the primary effects of drugs lead to addiction remains incomplete. Recently, researchers have turned to the invertebrate model systems Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans to dissect the mechanisms by which abused drugs modulate behavior. Due to their sophisticated genetics, relatively simple anatomy, and their remarkable molecular similarity to mammals, these invertebrate models should provide useful insights into the mechanisms of drug action. Here we review recent behavioral and genetic studies in flies and worms on the effects of ethanol, cocaine, and nicotine, three of the most widely abused drugs in the world.},

To assess the influence of the mushroom bodies on walking activity, three independent noninvasive methods interfering with mushroom body function are applied: chemical ablation of the mushroom body precursor cells; a mutant affecting Kenyon cell differentiation (mushroom body miniature1); and the targeted expression of the catalytic subunit of tetanus toxin in subsets of Kenyon cells. All groups of flies with mushroom body defects show an elevated level of total walking activity. This increase is attributable to the slower and less complete attenuation of activity during the experiment. Walking activity in normal and mushroom body-deficient flies is clustered in active phases (bouts) and rest periods (pauses). Neither the initiation nor the internal structure, but solely the termination of bouts seems to be affected by the mushroom body defects. How this finding relates to the well-documented role of the mushroom bodies in olfactory learning and memory remains to be understood.},

This new mutation caused spontaneous repetitive firing in motor axons and increased transmitter release. Complementation tests showed that it is allelic to eag. Combining either eag allele with various Sh alleles reproduced the same extreme defect observed in the original ShrK0120 strain. Thus, from their effects on neuromuscular transmission no qualitative difference among Sh alleles is apparent while Sh, eag, and eag Sh double mutant individuals can be uniquely distinguished. Pharmacological experiments indicated that Sh affects a membrane component sensitive to the potassium channel blockers 4-AP and TEA while eag affects a component sensitive to TEA but not 4-AP. We suggest that eag and Sh preferentially disrupt different potassium currents explaining their synergistic interaction.},

abstract = {We report functional neuronal and synaptic transmission properties in Drosophila CNS neurons. Whole cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings were made from dorsally positioned neurons in the larval ventral nerve cord. Comparison of neuronal Green Fluorescent Protein markers and intracellular dye labeling revealed that recorded cells consisted primarily of identified motor neurons. Neurons had resting potentials of -50 to -60 mV and fired repetitive action potentials (APs) in response to depolarizing current injection. Acetylcholine application elicited large excitatory responses and AP bursts that were reversibly blocked by the nicotinic receptor antagonist D-tubocurarine (dtC). GABA and glutamate application elicited similar inhibitory responses that reversed near normal resting potential and were reversibly blocked by the chloride channel blocker picrotoxin. Multiple types of endogenous synaptically driven activity were present in most neurons, including fast spontaneous synaptic events resembling unitary excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and sustained excitatory currents and potentials. Sustained forms of endogenous activity ranged in amplitude from smaller subthreshold "intermediate" sustained events to large "rhythmic" events that supported bursts of APs. Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves or focal stimulation of the neuropil evoked sustained responses and fast EPSCs similar to endogenous events. Endogenous activity and evoked responses required external Ca(2+) and were reversibly blocked by dtC application, indicating that cholinergic synaptic transmission directly underlies observed activity. Synaptic current amplitude and frequency were reduced in shibire conditional dynamin mutants and increased in dunce cAMP phosphodiesterase mutants. These results complement and advance those of recent functional studies in Drosophila embryonic neurons and demonstrate the feasibility of in-depth synaptic transmission and plasticity studies in the Drosophila CNS.},

abstract = {Division of labor in honey bee colonies is influenced by the foraging gene (Amfor), which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Amfor upregulation in the bee brain is associated with the age-related transition from working in the hive to foraging for food outside, and cGMP treatment (which increases PKG activity) causes precocious foraging. We present two lines of evidence in support of the hypothesis that Amfor affects division of labor by modulating phototaxis. We first show that a subset of worker bees involved in the removal of corpses from the hive had forager-like brain levels of Amfor brain expression despite being middle aged; age-matched food-handlers, who do not leave the hive to perform their job, had low levels of Amfor expression. This finding suggests that occupations that involve working outside the hive are associated with high levels of Amfor in brain. Secondly, foragers were much more positively phototactic than hive bees in a laboratory assay, and cGMP treatment caused a precocious onset of positive phototaxis. The cGMP effect was not due to a general increase in behavioral activity; cGMP treatment had no effect on locomotor activity under either constant darkness or a light:dark regime. The cGMP effect also was not due to changes in circadian rhythmicity; cGMP treatment had no effect on age at onset of locomotor circadian rhythmicity or the period of rhythmicity. The effects of Amfor on phototaxis are not related to peripheral processing; electroretinogram analysis revealed no effect of cGMP treatment on photoreceptor activity and no differences between untreated hive bees and foragers. The cAMP/PKA pathway does not appear to be playing a similar role to cGMP/PKG in the honey bee; cAMP treatment did not affect phototaxis and gene expression analysis revealed task-related differences only for the gene encoding the regulatory subunit, but not the catalytic subunit, of PKA. Our findings implicate one neural process associated with honey bee division of labor that can be affected by naturally occurring changes in the expression of AMFOR:},

abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

The plasticity of intrinsic properties has been primarily attributed to modification of ion channel function and/or number. We have found a mechanism for intrinsic plasticity in rhythmically active Drosophila neurons that was not based on changes in ion conductance. Larval motor neurons had a long-lasting, sodium-dependent afterhyperpolarization (AHP) following bursts of action potentials that was mediated by the electrogenic activity of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase. This AHP persisted for multiple seconds following volleys of action potentials and was able to function as a pattern-insensitive integrator of spike number that was independent of external calcium. This current also interacted with endogenous Shal K(+) conductances to modulate spike timing for multiple seconds following rhythmic activity, providing a cellular memory of network activity on a behaviorally relevant timescale.},

We used the fly larva model to delineate the neurobiological basis of age-restricted response to environmental stimuli. Here we provide evidence for a fructose-responsive chemosensory pathway that modulates food-averse migratory and social behaviors. We found that fructose potently elicited larval food-averse behaviors, and painless (pain), a transient receptor potential channel that is responsive to noxious stimuli, was required for the fructose response. A subset of pain-expressing sensory neurons have been identified that show pain-dependent excitation by fructose. Although evolutionarily conserved avoidance mechanisms are widely appreciated for their roles in stress coping and survival, their biological importance in animal physiology and development remains unknown. Our findings demonstrate how an avoidance mechanism is recruited to facilitate animal development.},

These codes are characterized by highly specific, associative (i.e., dependent on combinations of features) and often invariant neuronal responses. Sparse representations present many advantages for memory storage and are, thus, of wide interest in sensory physiology. Here, we study the statistics of connectivity in an olfactory network that contributes to the generation of such codes: Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic neurons of the mushroom body (a structure involved in learning and memory in insects) receive inputs from a small population of broadly tuned principal neurons; from these inputs, KCs generate exquisitely selective responses and, thus, sparse representations. We find, surprisingly, that KCs are on average each connected to about 50\% of their input population. Simple analysis indicates that such connectivity indeed maximizes the difference between input vectors to KCs and helps to explain their high specificity.},

abstract = {Despite their importance for urban planning, traffic forecasting and the spread of biological and mobile viruses, our understanding of the basic laws governing human motion remains limited owing to the lack of tools to monitor the time-resolved location of individuals. Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L\'{e}vy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

We show that stimulation of neurons that??express neuropeptide F (dNPF), an ortholog of mammalian NPY, mimics food deprivation and promotes memory performance in satiated flies. Robust appetitive memory performance requires the dNPF receptor in six dopaminergic neurons that innervate a distinct region of the mushroom bodies. Blocking these dopaminergic neurons releases memory performance in satiated flies, whereas stimulation suppresses memory performance in hungry flies.

The understanding of the origin of such bursty patterns is hindered by the lack of tools to compare different systems using a common framework. We introduce two measures to distinguish the mechanisms responsible for the bursty nature of real signals, changes in the interevent times and memory. We find that while the burstiness of natural phenomena is rooted in both the interevent time distribution and memory, for human dynamics memory is weak, and the bursty character is due to changes in the interevent time distribution. Finally, we show that current models lack in their ability to reproduce the activity pattern observed in real systems, opening up new avenues for future work.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is emerging as a promising model system for the genetic dissection of sleep. As in mammals, sleep in the fruit fly is a reversible state of reduced responsiveness to the external world and has been defined using an array of behavioral, pharmacologic, molecular, and electrophysiologic criteria. A central feature of mammalian sleep is its homeostatic regulation by the amount of previous wakefulness. Dissecting the mechanisms of homeostatic regulation is likely to provide key insights into the functions of sleep. Thus, it is important to establish to what extent sleep homeostasis is similar between mammals and flies. This study was designed to determine whether in flies, as in mammals, (1) sleep rebound is dependent on prior time awake; (2) sleep deprivation affects the intensity, in addition to the duration, of sleep rebound; (3) sleep loss impairs vigilance and performance; (4) the sleep homeostatic response is conserved among different wild-type lines, and between female and male flies of the same line. DESIGN: Motor activity of individual flies was recorded at 1-minute intervals using the infrared Drosophila Activity Monitoring System during 2 baseline days; during 6, 12, and 24 hours of sleep deprivation; and during 2 days of recovery. Sleep was defined as any period of uninterrupted behavioral immobility lasting > 5 minutes. Sleep continuity was measured by calculating the number of brief awakenings, the number and duration of sleep episodes, and a sleep continuity score. Vigilance before and after sleep deprivation was assessed by measuring the escape response triggered by 2 different aversive stimuli. SETTING: Fly sleep research laboratory at UW-Madison. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Adult flies of the Canton-S (CS) strain and 116 other wild-type lines (> or = 16 female and > or = 16 male flies per line). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In wild-type CS flies, as in mammals, the amount of sleep recovered after sleep deprivation was dependent on prior time awake. Relative to baseline sleep, recovery sleep in CS flies was less fragmented, with longer sleep episodes, and was associated with a higher arousal threshold. Sleep deprivation in CS flies also reduced performance. Sleep duration and continuity increased after 24 hour of sleep deprivation in all the other wild-type lines tested. CONCLUSION: The sleep homeostatic response in fruit flies is a stable phenotype and shares most of, if not all, the major features of mammalian sleep homeostasis, thus supporting the use of Drosophila as a model system for the genetic dissection of sleep mechanisms and functions.},

In contrast, receptor clustering was defective in mutants in which both spontaneous and evoked vesicle exocytosis were absent.

abstract = {Balancing the acquisition, allocation and storage of energy during periods of food deprivation is critical for survival. We show that natural variation in the foraging (for) gene, which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, affects behavioral and physiological responses to short-term food deprivation. Rover and sitter, natural allelic variants of for, differ in their stored carbohydrate reserves as well as their response to short-term deprivation. Fewer carbohydrates are stored in the fat body of rovers compared with sitters, and more labeled glucose is allocated to lipid stores compared with carbohydrate stores during a short feeding bout. Short-term food deprivation decreases hemolymph glucose levels in rovers but not in sitters. After food deprivation, rovers increase their food intake more slowly than sitters, and rover hemolymph levels take longer to respond to re-feeding. Finally, rovers have lower adipokinetic hormone (akh) mRNA levels than sitters. Our data suggest that for mediates larval responses to short-term food deprivation by altering food intake and blood glucose levels.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms in animals are regulated at the level of individual cells and by systemic signaling to coordinate the activities of multiple tissues. The circadian pacemakers have several physiological outputs, including daily locomotor rhythms. Several redox-active compounds have been found to function in regulation of circadian rhythms in cells, however, how particular compounds might be involved in regulating specific animal behaviors remains largely unknown. Here the effects of hydrogen peroxide on Drosophila movement were analyzed using a recently developed three-dimensional real-time multiple fly tracking assay. Both hydrogen peroxide feeding and direct injection of hydrogen peroxide caused increased adult fly locomotor activity. Continuous treatment with hydrogen peroxide also suppressed daily locomotor rhythms. Conditional over-expression of the hydrogen peroxide-producing enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) also increased fly activity and altered the patterns of locomotor activity across days and weeks. The real-time fly tracking system allowed for detailed analysis of the effects of these manipulations on behavior. For example, both hydrogen peroxide feeding and SOD over-expression increased all fly motion parameters, however, hydrogen peroxide feeding caused relatively more erratic movement, whereas SOD over-expression produced relatively faster-moving flies. Taken together, the data demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide has dramatic effects on fly movement and daily locomotor rhythms, and implicate hydrogen peroxide in the normal control of these processes.},

Here, we show the 25\% memory impairment in Drosophila melanogaster offspring solely dependent on the age of the parents and also passed on to the F2 generation. Furthermore, this parental age effect was not attributed to a generalized reduction in condition of the offspring but was specific to short-term memory. We also provide evidence implicating oxidative stress as a causal factor by showing that lines selected for resistance to oxidative stress did not display a memory impairment in offspring of old parents. The identification of the parental age-related memory impairment in a model system should stimulate integration between mechanistic studies of age-related mortality risk and functional studies of parental age effects on the fitness of future generations.},

abstract = {Activins are members of the TGF-?? superfamily of secreted growth factors that control a diverse array of processes in vertebrates including endocrine function, cell proliferation, differentiation, immune response and wound repair. In Drosophila, the Activin ligand Dawdle (Daw) has been shown to regulate several aspects of neuronal development such as embryonic axonal pathfinding, neuroblast proliferation in the larval brain and growth cone motility in the visual system. Here we identify a novel role for Activin signaling in regulating synaptic growth at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Mutants for Daw, the Activin type I receptor Baboon (Babo), and the signal transducer dSmad2, display reduced NMJ size suggesting that Daw utilizes a canonical Activin signal-transduction pathway in this context. Additionally, loss of Daw/Babo activity affects microtubule stability, axonal transport and distribution of Futsch, the Drosophila microtubule associated protein 1B (MAP1B) homolog. We find that Babo signaling is required postsynaptically in the muscle, in contrast to the well-characterized retrograde BMP/Gbb signal that is required for synaptic growth and function in presynaptic cells. Finally, we show that the Daw/Babo pathway acts upstream of gbb, and is involved in maintenance of muscle gbb expression, suggesting that Activins regulate NMJ growth by modulating BMP activity through transcriptional regulation of ligand expression. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The development of the nervous system is influenced by environmental factors. Among all environmental factors, temperature belongs to a unique category. Besides activating some specific sensory pathways, it exerts nonspecific, pervasive effects directly on the entire nervous system, especially in exothermic species. This study uses mutants to genetically discover how temperature affects nerve terminal arborization at larval neuromuscular junctions of Drosophila. It is known that hyperexcitability in K(+) channel mutants leads to enhanced ramification of larval nerve terminals. Elevated cAMP levels in dunce mutants with reduced phosphodiesterase activity also cause enhanced arborization. These genetic alterations are thought to perturb mechanisms relevant to activity-dependent neural plasticity, in which neuronal activity activates the cAMP pathway, and consequently affect nerve terminal arborization by regulating expression of adhesion molecules. Here we demonstrate the robust influence of rearing temperature on motor nerve terminal arborization. Analysis of ion channel and cAMP pathway mutants indicates that this temperature-dependent plasticity is mediated via neuronal activity changes linked to mechanisms controlled by the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase.},

abstract = {Locomotor activity in Drosophila, as in other organisms, is an important trait since it is at the basis of almost all behaviours. Indeed, the locomotor centre is implicated in all complex behaviours consisting of a change in the position of the animal with respect to its environment. Despite its importance, locomotor activity itself has received sparse attention for the following two reasons: first, until recently, the study of locomotor activity has lacked a well automated and standardised paradigm which is necessary for a detailed description. Second, locomotor activity is complicated by many factors (genetic, feeding, temperature), and as such is rather difficult to study. With recent technological developments, locomotor activity is now more accessible to automated paradigms. These have permitted us to reveal that locomotor activity is a very complex and rich behaviour that follows strict rules, harbours an organised (fractal-like) structure, and consequently might adhere to highly organised neurophysiological processes. Undoubtedly, locomotor activity has now reached a scientific maturity that allows it to be studied with the panoply of neuroethological approaches, in particular genetic, to unravel its mechanisms and neural circuitry. Consequently, we propose that locomotor activity can now represent a relevant biomarker to study various model diseases such as addiction, Parkinson, Alzheimer, Huntington, and diabetes. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This increase in synaptic dopamine levels is believed to act as a positive reinforcer and to mediate some of the acute responses to drugs. The mechanisms by which dopamine regulates acute drug responses and addiction remain unknown. Results: We present evidence that dopamine plays a role in the responses of Drosophila to cocaine, nicotine or ethanol. We used a startle-induced negative geotaxis assay and a locomotor tracking system to measure the effect of psychostimulants on fly behavior. Using these assays, we show that acute responses to cocaine and nicotine are blunted by pharmacologically induced reductions in dopamine levels. Cocaine and nicotine showed a high degree of synergy in their effects, which is consistent with an action through convergent pathways. In addition, we found that dopamine is involved in the acute locomotor-activating effect, but not the sedating effect, of ethanol. Conclusions: We show that in Drosophila, as in mammals, dopaminergic pathways play a role in modulating specific behavioral responses to cocaine, nicotine or ethanol. We therefore suggest that Drosophila can be used as a genetically tractable model system in which to study the mechanisms underlying behavioral responses to multiple drugs of abuse.},

abstract = {The roles of cells within the nervous system are based on their properties of excitability, which are in part governed by voltage-gated ion channels. HCN channels underlie the hyperpolarization-activated current, Ih, an important regulator of excitability and rhythmicity through control of basic membrane properties. Ih is present in multiple neuronal types and regions of the central nervous system, and changes in Ih alter cellular input-output properties and neuronal circuitry important for behavior such as learning and memory. Furthermore, the pathophysiology of neurological diseases of both the central and peripheral nervous system involves defects in excitability, rhythmicity, and signaling, and animal models of many of these disorders have implicated changes in HCN channels and Ih as critical for pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on recent research elucidating the role of HCN channels and Ih in behavior and disease. These studies have utilized knockout mice as well as animal models of disease to examine how Ih may be important in regulating learning and memory, sleep, and consciousness, as well as how misregulation of Ih may contribute to epilepsy, chronic pain, and other neurological disorders. This review will help guide future studies aimed at further understanding the function of this unique conductance in both health and disease of the mammalian brain. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {General anesthesia, sleep, and selective attention represent different states of arousal that have been associated with changes in consciousness in humans. Just as Drosophila melanogaster has proved useful toward understanding phenomena such as nervous system development or circadian rhythms, it may also prove useful towards understanding general anesthesia, sleep, and selective attention-three consciousness-related variables accessible to fly research. Unlike some nebulous checklists for consciousness (language, play, abstraction, and the like), these variables benefit from very well-defined criteria for their evaluation (quantitative behavioral responsiveness levels) and they consequently seem entirely knowable at a mechanistic level. It is suggested that via genetic analysis the mechanisms of these three phenomena may be understood. On a broader level, genetic analysis allows different behavioral phenomena such as these to be drawn together in correlation. Genetic studies never assume that a single change in a gene explains a phenomenon such as attention or sleep. Rather, changes in distinct phenomena, such as attention or sleep can be related precisely because all is held constant in the organism except for one lesion at a time affecting a specific network of cells. Thus, it is possible that a suite of molecularly related changes will affect anesthetic sensitivity, sleep, attention, learning and memory all at once. Genetic approaches to behavioral responsiveness in Drosophila should organize these phenomena to produce a model of arousal that could be compared to electrophysiological and pharmacological data from the same or other species. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In order to elucidate the behavioral significance of the central complex (CC), we have examined walking in 15 Drosophila mutant strains belonging to eight independent X-linked genes that affect the structure of the CC. Compared to four different wild-type strains, all are impaired either in a general or in a paradigm-dependent manner. Behavioral deficits concern walking activity, walking speed, or "straightness of walking" as measured in an object fixation task, in fast phototaxis, and in negative geotaxis. Behavioral deficits of three strains with mutations in different genes were studied in detail using mosaic analysis and high-speed cinematography. In all cases the focus for declining walking activity is located in the brain and is fully correlated with the respective defect of the CC. A high correlation between the degree of the behavioral impairment and the severity of the structural defect in two strains further adds to the evidence. Declining walking activity is not an unspecific side effect of structural brain defects, as steady walking is observed in structural mutants of the visual system and mushroom bodies. In mutant flies no-bridgeKS49 (nob), step size as a function of the stepping period is reduced. The focus of the resulting reduced average and maximum walking speeds resides in the brain and, again, the behavioral impairment fully correlates with the structural defects of the CC. While no indication is found for a role of the CC in setting up the basic stepping rhythm in straight walking (a respective phenotype in mutant central-complexKS181 flies resides in the ventral ganglion), a role in turning and start/stop maneuvers is suggested by aberrations in the stepping pattern of nob flies during such episodes.},

To understand the molecular regulation of sleep-like rest, we investigated the involvement of a candidate gene, cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB). The duration of rest was inversely related to cAMP signaling and CREB activity. Acutely blocking CREB activity in transgenic flies did not affect the clock, but increased rest rebound. CREB mutants also had a prolonged and increased homeostatic rebound. In wild types, in vivo CREB activity increased after rest deprivation and remained elevated for a 72-hour recovery period. These data indicate that cAMP signaling has a non-circadian role in waking and rest homeostasis in Drosophila.},

abstract = {The Drosophila giant fiber jump-and-flight escape response is a model for genetic analysis of both the physiology and the plasticity of a sensorimotor behavioral pathway. We previously established the electrically induced giant fiber response in intact tethered flies as a model for habituation, a form of nonassociative learning. Here, we show that the rate of stimulus-dependent response decrement of this neural pathway in a habituation protocol is correlated with PKG (cGMP-Dependent Protein Kinase) activity and foraging behavior. We assayed response decrement for natural and mutant rover and sitter alleles of the foraging (for) gene that encodes a Drosophila PKG. Rover larvae and adults, which have higher PKG activities, travel significantly farther while foraging than sitters with lower PKG activities. Response decrement was most rapid in genotypes previously shown to have low PKG activities and sitter-like foraging behavior. We also found differences in spontaneous recovery (the reversal of response decrement during a rest from stimulation) and a dishabituation-like phenomenon (the reversal of response decrement evoked by a novel stimulus). This electrophysiological study in an intact animal preparation provides one of the first direct demonstrations that PKG can affect plasticity in a simple learning paradigm. It increases our understanding of the complex interplay of factors that can modulate the sensitivity of the giant fiber escape response, and it defines a new adult-stage phenotype of the foraging locus. Finally, these results show that behaviorally relevant neural plasticity in an identified circuit can be influenced by a single-locus genetic polymorphism existing in a natural population of Drosophila.},

Dopamine-depleted females show increased resistance to copulation; 20-day-old females demonstrated an increase in copulation avoidance compared with younger (5-15-day-old) females. These changes in dopaminergic-modulated behaviors observed during aging parallel declines in whole body levels of dopamine. Immunocytochemical analysis of adult brains using an antibody raised against Drosophila tyrosine hydroxylase to visualize catecholaminergic cell bodies revealed increased degeneration of the cell bodies with aging.

Recent work sheds light on the information that is conveyed by bursts about sensory stimuli, on the cellular mechanisms that underlie bursting, and on how feedback can control the firing mode of burst-capable neurons, depending on the behavioural context.

The effects of PKG on behaviour have been studied in diverse taxa from perspectives as varied as ethology, evolution, genetics and neuropharmacology. The genetic variation of the Drosophila melanogaster gene, foraging (for), has provided a fertile model for examining natural variation in a single major gene influencing behaviour. Concurrent studies in other invertebrates and mammals suggest that PKG is an important signalling molecule with varied influences on behaviour and a large degree of pleiotropy and plasticity. Comparing these cross-taxa effects suggests that there are several potentially overlapping behavioural modalities in which PKG signalling acts to influence behaviours which include feeding, learning, stress and biological rhythms. More in-depth comparative analyses across taxa of the similarities and differences of the influence of PKG on behaviour may provide powerful mechanistic explications of the evolution of behaviour.},

abstract = {Presynaptic Ih channels become activated during a tetanus through membrane hyperpolarization resulting from Na+ accumulation and electrogenic Na+/K+ exchange. Ih activation is obligatory for inducing long-term facilitation (LTF), a long-lasting synaptic strengthening. cAMP-induced synaptic enhancement also requires Ih activation, and both processes are sensitive to actin depolymerization. Other mechanisms are responsible for expression of the responses. Once initiated, continued response to cAMP is Ih and actin independent. Moreover, LTF-induced activation of Ih renders subsequent cAMP enhancement insensitive to both Ih blockers and actin depolymerization. This actin-stabilized "temporal synaptic tagging" set by Ih activation is prolonged when Ih is activated concurrent with an elevation in presynaptic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), permitting the further strengthening of synapses given appropriate additional stimuli.},

abstract = {Mutations of the Shaker (Sh) locus of Drosophila reduce, eliminate, or otherwise alter a transient potassium current, IA, in muscle. Recent molecular studies indicate that the Sh locus produces several proteins by alternative splicing, but the relationships of the variety of Sh gene products to IA channels in the various excitable membranes still remain to be determined. In Drosophila, many enzymes have been shown to exhibit gene-dosage effects; their amounts vary in direct proportion to the number of structural genes present. We describe a physiological isolation of IA in larval muscle which allowed precise quantification of gene-dosage effects on IA in Sh heterozygotes and aneuploids. We found that doubling the number of Sh genes in aneuploids increased IA to twice that of normal, consistent with the notion that the Sh locus encodes the entire IA channel in larval muscle. We further examined heterozygous combinations of different Sh mutations for evidence of interactions among Sh gene products within the IA channel, which may yield clues to the possible subunit composition of the channel. Combinations among 5 Sh mutations plus their normal counterpart followed a simple gene-dosage effect; in each case the resulting IA was about the average of the homozygous currents, compatible with the notion of additive contributions from 2 independent populations of IA channels. Two additional Sh mutations caused pronounced departures from the simple dosage effect; the amplitude of IA in heterozygotes was significantly smaller than that expected from gene dosage, a strong dominant effect attributable to interactions among protein subunits. These contrasting observations may be accounted for by certain hetero- or homo-multimeric arrangements of Sh products in the IA channel.},

Eight clusters of putative dopaminergic neurons were characterized. Neurons in three of the clusters project to the mushroom body neuropil: PAM neurons project to the medial portion of the horizontal lobes; PPL1 neurons project to the vertical lobes, the junction area, the heel and distal peduncle; and PPL2ab neurons project to the calyx. Five types of PPL1 neurons were discovered that innervate different zones of the mushroom body lobes. Functional imaging experiments showed that the dopaminergic processes in four of the zones differ in response properties to odor, electric shock, or following the pairing of odor and electric shock. These results indicate that distinct dopaminergic neurons define separate zones of the mushroom body lobes and are probably involved in different functions. Differences in functional response properties of these neurons suggest that they are involved in different behavioral processes.},

In contrast, receptor clustering was defective in mutants in which both spontaneous and evoked vesicle exocytosis were absent. Thus, spontaneous vesicle exocytosis appears to be tightly linked to the clustering of glutamate receptors during development.},

abstract = {Drosophila male courtship is a complex and robust behavior, the potential for which is genetically built into specific neural circuits in the central nervous system. Previous studies using male-female mosaics and the flies with defects in particular brain structures implicated the critical central regions involved in male courtship behavior. However, their acute physiological roles in courtship regulation still largely remain unknown. Using the temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutation, shibire(ts1), here we demonstrate the significance of two major brain structures, the mushroom bodies and the central complex, in experience-independent aspects of male courtship. We show that blocking of synaptic transmission in the mushroom body intrinsic neurons significantly delays courtship initiation and reduces the courtship activity by shortening the courtship bout length when virgin females are used as a sexual target. Interestingly, however, the same treatment affects neither initiation nor maintenance of courtship toward young males that release courtship-stimulating pheromones different from those of virgin females. In contrast, blocking of synaptic transmission in a central complex substructure, the fan-shaped body, slightly but significantly reduces courtship activity toward both virgin females and young males with little effect on courtship initiation. Taken together, our results indicate that the neuronal activity in the mushroom bodies plays an important role in responding to female-specific sex pheromones that stimulate initiation and maintenance of male courtship behavior, whereas the fan-shaped body neurons are involved in maintenance of male courtship regardless of the nature of courtship-stimulating cues.},

abstract = {In recent years, a number of tools have become available for remotely activating neural circuits in Drosophila. Despite widespread and growing use, very little work has been done to characterize exactly how these tools affect activity in identified fly neurons. Using the GAL4-UAS system, we expressed blue light-gated Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and a mutated form of ChR2 (H134R-ChR2) in motor and sensory neurons of the Drosophila third-instar locomotor circuit. Neurons expressing H134R-ChR2 show enhanced responses to blue light pulses and less spike frequency adaptation than neurons expressing ChR2. Although H134R-ChR2 was more effective at manipulating behavior than ChR2, the behavioral consequences of firing rate adaptation were different in sensory and motor neurons. For comparison, we examined the effects of ectopic expression of the warmth-activated cation channel Drosophila TRPA1 (dTRPA1). When dTRPA1 was expressed in larval motor neurons, heat ramps from 21 to 27 degrees C evoked tonic spiking at approximately 25 degrees C that showed little adaptation over many minutes. dTRPA1 activation had stronger and longer-lasting effects on behavior than ChR2 variants. These results suggest that dTRPA1 may be particularly useful for researchers interested in activating fly neural circuits over long time scales. Overall, this work suggests that understanding the cellular effects of these genetic tools and their temporal dynamics is important for the design and interpretation of behavioral experiments.},

abstract = {Dopamine (DA) is the only catecholaminergic neurotransmitter in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Dopaminergic neurons have been identified in the larval and adult central nervous system (CNS) in Drosophila and other insects, but no specific genetic tool was available to study their development, function, and degeneration in vivo. In Drosophila as in vertebrates, the rate-limiting step in DA biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The Drosophila TH gene (DTH) is specifically expressed in all dopaminergic cells and the corresponding mutant, pale (ple), is embryonic lethal. We have performed ple rescue experiments with modified DTH transgenes. Our results indicate that partially redundant regulatory elements located in DTH introns are required for proper expression of this gene in the CNS. Based on this study, we generated a GAL4 driver transgene, TH-GAL4, containing regulatory sequences from the DTH 5' flanking and downstream coding regions. TH-GAL4 specifically expresses in dopaminergic cells in embryos, larval CNS, and adult brain when introduced into the Drosophila genome. As a first application of this driver, we observed that in vivo inhibition of DA release induces a striking hyperexcitability behavior in adult flies. We propose that TH-GAL4 will be useful for studies of the role of DA in behavior and disease models in Drosophila.},

@article{Martin1999,
abstract = {The temporal pattern of locomotor activity of single Drosophila melanogaster flies freely walking in small tubes is described. Locomotor activity monitored by a light gate has a characteristic time-course that depends upon age and the environmental conditions. Several methods are applied to assess the complexity of the temporal pattern. The pattern varies according to sex, genotype, age and environmental conditions (food; light). Activity occurs clustered in bouts. The intrinsic bout structure is quantified by four parameters: number of light gate passages (counts) per bout, duration of a bout, pause between two successive bouts and mean bout period. In addition, the distribution of the periods between light-gate crossings (inter-count intervals) as function of inter-count interval duration reveals a power law, suggesting that the overall distribution of episodes of activity and inactivity has a fractal structure. In the dark without food, the fractal dimension which represents a measure of the complexity of the pattern is sex, genotype and age specific. Fractality is abolished by additional sensory stimulation (food; light). We propose that time-course, bout structure and fractal dimension of the temporal pattern of locomotor activity describe different aspects of the fly's central pattern generator for locomotion and its motivational control.},

abstract = {An important body of evidence documents the differential expression of ion channels in brains, suggesting they are essential to endow particular brain structures with specific physiological properties. Because of their role in correlating inputs and outputs in neurons, modulation of voltage-dependent ion channels (VDICs) can profoundly change neuronal network dynamics and performance, and may represent a fundamental mechanism for behavioral plasticity, one that has received less attention in learning and memory studies. Revisiting three paradigmatic mutations altering olfactory learning and memory in Drosophila (dunce, leonardo, amnesiac) a link was established between each mutation and the operation of VDICs in Kenyon cells, the intrinsic neurons of the mushroom bodies (MBs). In Drosophila, MBs are essential to the emergence of olfactory associative learning and retention. Abnormal ion channel operation might underlie failures in neuronal physiology, and be crucial to understand the abnormal associative learning and retention phenotypes the mutants display. We also discuss the only case in which a mutation in an ion channel gene (shaker) has been directly linked to olfactory learning deficits. We analyze such evidence in light of recent discoveries indicating an unusual ion current profile in shaker mutant MB intrinsic neurons. We anticipate that further studies of acquisition and retention mutants will further confirm a link between such mutations and malfunction of specific ion channel mechanisms in brain structures implicated in learning and memory.},

It is well known that many physical processes in nature and society display long-range correlations. Hence, in the last few years, considerable research effort has been directed towards studying the distribution of return intervals for long-range correlated time series. Based on numerical simulations, it was shown that the return interval distributions are of stretched exponential type. In this paper, we obtain an analytical expression for the distribution of return intervals in long-range correlated time series which holds good when the average return intervals are large. We show that the distribution is actually a product of power law and a stretched exponential form. We also discuss the regimes of validity and perform detailed studies on how the return interval distribution depends on the threshold used to define extreme events.},

Studies of patients with localized brain damage and work in rodent model systems, for example, have shown that the hippocampal formation participates in acquisition of declarative tasks but is not the site of their long-term storage. Such lesions are usually irreversible, however, which has limited their use for dissecting the temporal processes of acquisition, storage and retrieval of memories. Studies in bees and flies have similarly revealed a distinct anatomical region of the insect brain, the mushroom body, that is involved specifically in olfactory associative learning. We have used a temperature-sensitive dynamin transgene, which disrupts synaptic transmission reversibly and on the time-scale of minutes, to investigate the temporal requirements for ongoing neural activity during memory formation. Here we show that synaptic transmission from mushroom body neurons is required during memory retrieval but not during acquisition or storage. We propose that the hebbian processes underlying olfactory associative learning reside in mushroom body dendrites or upstream of the mushroom body and that the resulting alterations in synaptic strength modulate mushroom body output during memory retrieval.},

We show that stimulation of neurons that??express neuropeptide F (dNPF), an ortholog of mammalian NPY, mimics food deprivation and promotes memory performance in satiated flies. Robust appetitive memory performance requires the dNPF receptor in six dopaminergic neurons that innervate a distinct region of the mushroom bodies.

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a major modulator of neural functions. Since NO is a gaseous molecule with very short half-life, the spatial distribution of NO and its relationship to neuronal activity are difficult to resolve. Non-invasive and direct visualization of NO in neuronal tissues had been hampered by the lack of a suitable method to identify NO directly. A fluorescent indicator, which directly detects NO under physiological conditions, would be advantageous. Several indicators for direct detection of NO have been developed, which react with NO by forming a fluorescent complex. However, some of these dyes have cytotoxic properties or have been found to be rather unspecific under certain conditions. Fortunately, some of the indicators, which change their fluorescent pattern in the presence of NO, appear to be promising for the visualization of NO. Since little is known about the spatial spread and the temporal aspects of NO release after a specific stimulus, the use of the specific and non-toxic fluorescent NO indicators could provide a potentially powerful tool to study these aspects of NO release in neuronal tissues in vitro and in vivo. Such measurements, especially in combination with electrophysiological recordings, would greatly further NO research. In addition, based on their fluorescent pattern, these NO-sensitive dyes can be distinguished from the calcium-sensitive dye Fura-2, which allows NO-imaging together with calcium-imaging. This article summarizes recent advances and current trends in the visualization of NO in living neuronal tissues.},

abstract = {The question of how genes contribute to normal individual differences in behavior has captured our imagination for more than a century. Several fundamental questions come to mind. How do genes and their proteins act in the nervous system and in response to the environment in order to cause individual differences in behavior? Do genetic differences between natural variants arise from alterations in the structural or regulatory region of a gene? Can we predict which genes for behavior, identified by mutant analysis in the laboratory, will have natural allelic variation? Three groundbreaking studies (Osborne et al., 1997; Sawyer et al., 1997; de Bono and Bargmann, 1998) published in the past year demonstrate that we now have the knowledge and technological capability to address these questions empirically. Each study has successfully identified a single major gene for a given behavior and, with the aid of transgenic animals, shown that its gene product is responsible for naturally occurring individual differences},

abstract = {Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity has been implicated in the refinement and modification of neural circuits during development and learning. Previous studies show that activity-induced facilitation and potentiation are disrupted at larval neuromuscular junctions in the memory mutants dunce (dnc) and rutabaga (rut) of Drosophila. The diminished learning-memory capacity and synaptic transmission plasticity have been associated with altered cAMP levels since dnc affects the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase and rut affects adenylate cyclase. In this study, the morphology of larval motor axon terminals was examined by anti-HRP immunohistochemistry. It was found that the numbers of terminal varicosities and branches were increased in dnc mutants, which have elevated cAMP concentrations. Such increase was suppressed in dnc rut double mutants by rut mutations, which reduce cAMP synthesis. More profuse projections of larval motor axons have also been reported in double-mutant combinations of ether \`{a} go-go (eag) and Shaker (Sh) alleles, which display greatly enhanced nerve activity as a result of reduction in different K+ currents. Therefore, we examined combinations of dnc and rut with eag and Sh mutations to explore the possible relation between activity- and cAMP-induced morphological changes. We found that the expanded projections in dnc were further enhanced in double mutants of dnc with either eag or Sh, an effect that could again be suppressed by rut. The results provide evidence for altered plasticity of synaptic morphology in memory mutants dnc and rut and suggest a role of cAMP cascade in mediating activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {The distribution and morphology of neurons reacting with antisera against dopamine (DA), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and histamine (HA) were analyzed in the blowflies Calliphora erythrocephala and Phormia terraenovae. TH-immunoreactive (THIR) and HA-immunoreactive (HAIR) neurons were also mapped in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. The antisera against DA and TH specifically labeled the same neurons in the blowflies. About 300 neurons displayed DA immunoreactivity (DAIR) and THIR in the brain and subesophageal ganglion of the blowflies. Most of these neurons were located in bilateral clusters; some were distributed as bilateral pairs, and two ventral unpaired median (VUM) neurons were seen in the subesophageal ganglion. Immunoreactive processes were found in all compartments of the mushroom bodies except the calyces, in all divisions of the central body complex, in the medulla, lobula and lobula plate of the optic lobe, and in non-glomerular neuropil of protocerebrum, tritocerebrum and the subesophageal ganglion. No DA or TH immunoreactivity was seen in the antennal lobes. In Drosophila, neurons homologous to the blowfly neurons were detected with the TH antiserum. In Phormia and Drosophila, 18 HA-immunoreactive neurons were located in the protocerebrum and 2 in the subesophageal ganglion. The HAIR neurons arborized extensively, but except for processes in the lobula, all HAIR processes were seen in non-glomerular neuropil. The deuto- and tritocerebrum was devoid of HAIR processes. Double labeling experiments demonstrated that TH and HA immunoreactivity was not colocalized in any neuron. In some regions there was, however, substantial superposition between the two systems. The morphology of the extensively arborizing aminergic neurons described suggests that they have modulatory functions in the brain and subesophageal ganglion.},

abstract = {Although mammals of different species have different sleep patterns, brief sleep-wake transitions commonly are observed across species and appear to occur randomly throughout the sleeping period. The dynamical patterns and functions of these brief awakenings from sleep are not well understood, and they often are viewed as disruptions (random or pathologic) of the sleep process. In this article, we hypothesize that brief awakenings from sleep may reflect aspects of the endogenous sleep control mechanism and thus may exhibit certain robust dynamical patterns across species. We analyze sleep recordings from mice, rats, cats, and humans, and we compare the distributions of sleep and wake episode durations. For all four species, we find that durations of brief wake episodes during the sleep period exhibit a scale-free power-law behavior with an exponent alpha that remains the same for all species (alpha approximately equal to 2.2). In contrast, sleep episode durations for all four species follow exponential distributions with characteristic time scales, which change across species in relation to body mass and metabolic rate. Our findings suggest common dynamical features of brief awakenings and sleep durations across species and may provide insights into the dynamics of the neural circuits controlling sleep.},

abstract = {Optically gated ion channels were expressed in circumscribed groups of neurons in the Drosophila CNS so that broad illumination of flies evoked action potentials only in genetically designated target cells. Flies harboring the "phototriggers" in different sets of neurons responded to laser light with behaviors specific to the sites of phototrigger expression. Photostimulation of neurons in the giant fiber system elicited the characteristic escape behaviors of jumping, wing beating, and flight; photostimulation of dopaminergic neurons caused changes in locomotor activity and locomotor patterns. These responses reflected the direct optical activation of central neuronal targets rather than confounding visual input, as they persisted unabated in carriers of a mutation that eliminates phototransduction. Encodable phototriggers provide noninvasive control interfaces for studying the connectivity and dynamics of neural circuits, for assigning behavioral content to neurons and their activity patterns, and, potentially, for restoring information corrupted by injury or disease.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circadian clocks are biological oscillators that regulate molecular, physiological, and behavioral rhythms in a wide variety of organisms. While behavioral rhythms are typically monitored over many cycles, a similar approach to molecular rhythms was not possible until recently; the advent of real-time analysis using transgenic reporters now permits the observations of molecular rhythms over many cycles as well. This development suggests that new details about the relationship between molecular and behavioral rhythms may be revealed. Even so, behavioral and molecular rhythmicity have been analyzed using different methods, making such comparisons difficult to achieve. To address this shortcoming, among others, we developed a set of integrated analytical tools to unify the analysis of biological rhythms across modalities. RESULTS: We demonstrate an adaptation of digital signal analysis that allows similar treatment of both behavioral and molecular data from our studies of Drosophila. For both types of data, we apply digital filters to extract and clarify details of interest; we employ methods of autocorrelation and spectral analysis to assess rhythmicity and estimate the period; we evaluate phase shifts using crosscorrelation; and we use circular statistics to extract information about phase. CONCLUSION: Using data generated by our investigation of rhythms in Drosophila we demonstrate how a unique aggregation of analytical tools may be used to analyze and compare behavioral and molecular rhythms. These methods are shown to be versatile and will also be adaptable to further experiments, owing in part to the non-proprietary nature of the code we have developed.},

Here we show that presynaptic cAMP generation via serotonin receptor activation directly modulated hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (Ih channels) in axons. This modulation of Ih produced an increase in synaptic strength that could not be explained solely by depolarization of the presynaptic membrane.

abstract = {Arousal is fundamental to many behaviors, but whether it is unitary or whether there are different types of behavior-specific arousal has not been clear. In Drosophila, dopamine promotes sleep-wake arousal. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding its influence on environmentally stimulated arousal. Here we show that loss-of-function mutations in the D1 dopamine receptor DopR enhance repetitive startle-induced arousal while decreasing sleep-wake arousal (i.e., increasing sleep). These two types of arousal are also inversely influenced by cocaine, whose effects in each case are opposite to, and abrogated by, the DopR mutation. Selective restoration of DopR function in the central complex rescues the enhanced stimulated arousal but not the increased sleep phenotype of DopR mutants. These data provide evidence for at least two different forms of arousal, which are independently regulated by dopamine in opposite directions, via distinct neural circuits. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Robust innate behaviours are attractive systems for genetically dissecting how environmental cues are perceived and integrated to generate complex behaviours. During courtship, Drosophila males engage in a series of innate, stereotyped behaviours that are coordinated by specific sensory cues. However, little is known about the specific neural substrates mediating this complex behavioural programme. Genetic, developmental and behavioural studies have shown that the fruitless (fru) gene encodes a set of male-specific transcription factors (FruM) that act to establish the potential for courtship in Drosophila. FruM proteins are expressed in approximately 2\% of central nervous system neurons, at least one subset of which coordinates the component behaviours of courtship. Here we have inserted the yeast GAL4 gene into the fru locus by homologous recombination and show that (1) FruM is expressed in subsets of all peripheral sensory systems previously implicated in courtship, (2) inhibition of FruM function in olfactory system components reduces olfactory-dependent changes in courtship behaviour, (3) transient inactivation of all FruM-expressing neurons abolishes courtship behaviour, with no other gross changes in general behaviour, and (4) 'masculinization' of FruM-expressing neurons in females is largely sufficient to confer male courtship behaviour. Together, these data demonstrate that FruM proteins specify the neural substrates of male courtship.},

The depolarization-induced fusion is highly dependent on calcium ions, and, correspondingly, the transmission characteristics of synapses are thought to be influenced by the spatial arrangement of voltage-gated calcium channels with respect to vesicle release sites. Here, we review the involvement of the Drosophila Bruchpilot (BRP) protein in active zone assembly, a process that is required for the clustering of presynaptic calcium channels to ensure efficient vesicle release.},

abstract = {Brain size relative to body size varies considerably among animals, but the ecological consequences of that variation remain poorly understood. Plausibly, larger brains confer increased behavioural flexibility, and an ability to respond to novel challenges. In keeping with that hypothesis, successful invasive species of birds and mammals that flourish after translocation to a new area tend to have larger brains than do unsuccessful invaders. We found the same pattern in ectothermic terrestrial vertebrates. Brain size relative to body size was larger in species of amphibians and reptiles reported to be successful invaders, compared to species that failed to thrive after translocation to new sites. This pattern was found in six of seven global biogeographic realms; the exception (where relatively larger brains did not facilitate invasion success) was Australasia. Establishment success was also higher in amphibian and reptile families with larger relative brain sizes. Future work could usefully explore whether invasion success is differentially associated with enlargement of specific parts of the brain (as predicted by the functional role of the forebrain in promoting behavioural flexibility), or with a general size increase (suggesting that invasion success is facilitated by enhanced perceptual and motor skills, as well as cognitive ability).},

abstract = {Characterization of lifetime behavioral changes is essential for understanding aging and aging-related diseases. However, such studies are scarce partly due to the lack of efficient tools. Here we describe and provide proof of concept for a stereo vision system that classifies and sequentially records at an extremely fine scale six different behaviors (resting, micro-movement, walking, flying, feeding and drinking) and the within-cage (3D) location of individual tephritid fruit flies by time-of-day throughout their lives. Using flies fed on two different diets, full sugar-yeast and sugar-only diets, we report for the first time their behavioral changes throughout their lives at a high resolution. We have found that the daily activity peaks at the age of 15-20 days and then gradually declines with age for flies on both diets. However, the overall daily activity is higher for flies on sugar-only diet than those on the full diet. Flies on sugar-only diet show a stronger diurnal localization pattern with higher preference to staying on the top of the cage during the period of light-off when compared to flies on the full diet. Clustering analyses of age-specific behavior patterns reveal three distinct young, middle-aged and old clusters for flies on each of the two diets. The middle-aged groups for flies on sugar-only diet consist of much younger age groups when compared to flies on full diet. This technology provides research opportunities for using a behavioral informatics approach for understanding different ways in which behavior, movement, and aging in model organisms are mutually affecting.},

However, why some individuals are consistently bolder or more active than others, for example, is currently obscure. Given that life-history tradeoffs are common and known to promote inter-individual differences in behavior, we suggest that consistent individual differences in animal personality traits can be favored when those traits contribute to consistent individual differences in productivity (growth and/or fecundity). A survey of empirical studies indicates that boldness, activity and/or aggressiveness are positively related to food intake rates, productivity and other life-history traits in a wide range of taxa. Our conceptual framework sets the stage for a closer look at relationships between personality traits and life-history traits in animals. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

How do genes and their proteins act in the nervous system and in response to the environment in order to cause individual differences in behavior? Do genetic differences between natural variants arise from alterations in the structural or regulatory region of a gene? Can we predict which genes for behavior, identified by mutant analysis in the laboratory, will have natural allelic variation? Three groundbreaking studies (Osborne et al., 1997; Sawyer et al., 1997; de Bono and Bargmann, 1998) published in the past year demonstrate that we now have the knowledge and technological capability to address these questions empirically. Each study has successfully identified a single major gene for a given behavior and, with the aid of transgenic animals, shown that its gene product is responsible for naturally occurring individual differences},

abstract = {Bidirectional trans-synaptic signals induce synaptogenesis and regulate subsequent synaptic maturation. Presynaptically secreted Mind the gap (Mtg) molds the synaptic cleft extracellular matrix, leading us to hypothesize that Mtg functions to generate the intercellular environment required for efficient signaling. We show in Drosophila that secreted Jelly belly (Jeb) and its receptor tyrosine kinase Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) are localized to developing synapses. Jeb localizes to punctate aggregates in central synaptic neuropil and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) presynaptic terminals. Secreted Jeb and Mtg accumulate and colocalize extracellularly in surrounding synaptic boutons. Alk concentrates in postsynaptic domains, consistent with an anterograde, trans-synaptic Jeb-Alk signaling pathway at developing synapses. Jeb synaptic expression is increased in Alk mutants, consistent with a requirement for Alk receptor function in Jeb uptake. In mtg null mutants, Alk NMJ synaptic levels are reduced and Jeb expression is dramatically increased. NMJ synapse morphology and molecular assembly appear largely normal in jeb and Alk mutants, but larvae exhibit greatly reduced movement, suggesting impaired functional synaptic development. jeb mutant movement is significantly rescued by neuronal Jeb expression. jeb and Alk mutants display normal NMJ postsynaptic responses, but a near loss of patterned, activity-dependent NMJ transmission driven by central excitatory output. We conclude that Jeb-Alk expression and anterograde trans-synaptic signaling are modulated by Mtg and play a key role in establishing functional synaptic connectivity in the developing motor circuit.},

Recently, mutants of the Drosophila melanogaster ERC/CAST family protein Bruchpilot (BRP) were shown to lack dense projections (T-bars) and to suffer from Ca(2+) channel-clustering defects. In this study, we used high resolution light microscopy, electron microscopy, and intravital imaging to analyze the function of BRP in AZ assembly. Consistent with truncated BRP variants forming shortened T-bars, we identify BRP as a direct T-bar component at the AZ center with its N terminus closer to the AZ membrane than its C terminus. In contrast, Drosophila Liprin-alpha, another AZ-organizing protein, precedes BRP during the assembly of newly forming AZs by several hours and surrounds the AZ center in few discrete punctae. BRP seems responsible for effectively clustering Ca(2+) channels beneath the T-bar density late in a protracted AZ formation process, potentially through a direct molecular interaction with intracellular Ca(2+) channel domains.},

abstract = {Insulin and insulin growth factor have central roles in growth, metabolism and ageing of animals, including Drosophila melanogaster. In Drosophila, insulin-like peptides (Dilps) are produced by specialized neurons in the brain. Here we show that Drosophila short neuropeptide F (sNPF), an orthologue of mammalian neuropeptide Y (NPY), and sNPF receptor sNPFR1 regulate expression of Dilps. Body size was increased by overexpression of sNPF or sNPFR1. The fat body of sNPF mutant Drosophila had downregulated Akt, nuclear localized FOXO, upregulated translational inhibitor 4E-BP and reduced cell size. Circulating levels of glucose were elevated and lifespan was also extended in sNPF mutants. We show that these effects are mediated through activation of extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK) in insulin-producing cells of larvae and adults. Insulin expression was also increased in an ERK-dependent manner in cultured Drosophila central nervous system (CNS) cells and in rat pancreatic cells treated with sNPF or NPY peptide, respectively. Drosophila sNPF and the evolutionarily conserved mammalian NPY seem to regulate ERK-mediated insulin expression and thus to systemically modulate growth, metabolism and lifespan.},

abstract = {In vertebrates, sialylated glycans participate in a wide range of biological processes and affect the development and function of the nervous system. While the complexity of glycosylation and the functional redundancy among sialyltransferases provide obstacles for revealing biological roles of sialylation in mammals, Drosophila possesses a sole vertebrate-type sialyltransferase, Drosophila sialyltransferase (DSiaT), with significant homology to its mammalian counterparts, suggesting that Drosophila could be a suitable model to investigate the function of sialylation. To explore this possibility and investigate the role of sialylation in Drosophila, we inactivated DSiaT in vivo by gene targeting and analyzed phenotypes of DSiaT mutants using a combination of behavioral, immunolabeling, electrophysiological, and pharmacological approaches. Our experiments demonstrated that DSiaT expression is restricted to a subset of CNS neurons throughout development. We found that DSiaT mutations result in significantly decreased life span, locomotor abnormalities, temperature-sensitive paralysis, and defects of neuromuscular junctions. Our results indicate that DSiaT regulates neuronal excitability and affects the function of a voltage-gated sodium channel. Finally, we showed that sialyltransferase activity is required for DSiaT function in vivo, which suggests that DSiaT mutant phenotypes result from a defect in sialylation of N-glycans. This work provided the first evidence that sialylation has an important biological function in protostomes, while also revealing a novel, nervous system-specific function of alpha2,6-sialylation. Thus, our data shed light on one of the most ancient functions of sialic acids in metazoan organisms and suggest a possibility that this function is evolutionarily conserved between flies and mammals.},

abstract = {Fruit flies exhibit a sleep-like rest state that shares behavioral characteristics with mammalian sleep, including a homeostatic increase in rest after deprivation by mechanical methods. We tested the effect of modafinil, a novel wake-promoting agent, to discover whether its effect is conserved. Flies fed various concentrations of modafinil were compared to groups of control flies fed diluent only. Flies were also tested for a homeostatic response to the modafinil-related rest deprivation by examining rest and activity during recovery after 48H modafinil administration, compared to rest deprivation alone and to both treatments combined. The duration and consolidation of rest, and the duration, intensity, and circadian rhythms of activity were measured. Modafinil significantly and dose-dependently decreased rest when fed at concentrations from 2.5 mg/ml to 0.3125 mg/ml. Activity intensity was not increased, and circadian timing was unchanged, although the 2.5 mg/ml dose blunted the amplitude of overt circadian locomotor rhythms. Compared to controls, the duration of rest bouts was decreased in flies fed 2.5 mg/ml, and waking was frequently interrupted by 5-min periods of immobility. A rest rebound (significant increase in rest) followed withdrawal of either 2.5mg/ml or 0.625mg/ml modafinil after 48H. When directly compared to 6H total rest deprivation, the increase after withdrawal was briefer, reminiscent of the attenuated rest rebound seen in mammals, including humans, after modafinil. However, modafinil withdrawal combined with 6H total rest deprivation significantly enhanced the rebound, suggesting that a rest debt is accumulating during modafinil. We conclude that modafinil affects states of arousal in Drosophila in the same direction as it does in mammals. This discovery provides a tool for searching for conserved molecular mechanisms by which modafinil regulates rest and waking.},

Here we show that this relationship is far more than mere correlation. It can be attributable to different alleles at the same genetic locus of the behavioral gene foraging (for). The for gene offers us the unique opportunity to study the genetic basis and evolutionary significance of a naturally occurring behavioral polymorphism. Until now, only the effect of for on Drosophila melanogaster larval behavior was studied. Larvae with the rover allele (forR) move significantly more while eating during a set time period than those homozygous for the sitter alleles (fors). Here, we show that rover and sitter larval strains derived from nature differ in the distance adults walk after feeding per unit time and that this variation results from different alleles at the foraging locus, the very gene originally defined on the basis of larval behavior. We hypothesize that for may be involved in the way flies evaluate a food resource.},

Chemical ablation of the mushroom bodies also resulted in reduced sleep. These studies highlight a central role for the mushroom bodies in sleep regulation.},

abstract = {Locomotion is an integral component of most animal behaviors and many human diseases and disorders are associated with locomotor deficits, but little is known about the genetic basis of natural variation in locomotor behavior. Locomotion is a complex trait, with variation attributable to the joint segregation of multiple interacting quantitative trait loci (QTL), with effects that are sensitive to the environment. We assessed variation in a component of locomotor behavior (locomotor reactivity) in a population of 98 recombinant inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster and mapped four QTL affecting locomotor reactivity by linkage to polymorphic roo transposable element insertion sites. We used complementation tests of deficiencies to fine map these QTL to 12 chromosomal regions and complementation tests of mutations to identify 13 positional candidate genes affecting locomotor reactivity, including Dopa decarboxylase (Ddc), which catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of serotonin and dopamine. Linkage disequilibrium mapping in a population of 164 second chromosome substitution lines derived from a single natural population showed that polymorphisms at Ddc were associated with naturally occurring genetic variation in locomotor behavior. These data implicate variation in the synthesis of bioamines as a factor contributing to natural variation in locomotor reactivity.},

abstract = {We used a preparation of acutely dissociated neurons to quantify the ionic currents driving the spontaneous firing of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons, isolated from transgenic mice in which the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter drives expression of human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) on the outer surface of the cell membrane. Dissociated neurons identified by fluorescent antibodies to PLAP showed firing properties similar to those of dopaminergic neurons in brain slice, including rhythmic spontaneous firing of broad action potentials and, in some cells, rhythmic oscillatory activity in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). Spontaneous activity in TTX had broader, smaller spikes than normal pacemaking and was stopped by removal of external calcium. Normal pacemaking was also consistently silenced by replacement of external calcium by cobalt and was slowed by more specific calcium channel blockers. Nimodipine produced a slowing of pacemaking frequency. Pacemaking was also slowed by the P/Q-channel blocker omega-Aga-IVA, but the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA had no effect. In voltage-clamp experiments, using records of pacemaking as command voltage, cobalt-sensitive current and TTX-sensitive current were both sizeable at subthreshold voltages between spikes. Cobalt-sensitive current was consistently larger than TTX-sensitive current at interspike voltages from -70 to -50 mV, with TTX-sensitive current larger at voltages positive to -45 mV. These results support previous evidence for a major role of voltage-dependent calcium channels in driving pacemaking of midbrain dopamine neurons and suggest that multiple calcium channel types contribute to this function. The results also show a significant contribution of subthreshold TTX-sensitive sodium current.},

The rutabaga adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme that is ubiquitously expressed in the Drosophila brain and that mediates synaptic plasticity, is needed exclusively in the Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies for a component of olfactory short-term memory. This demonstrates that synaptic plasticity in a small brain region can be sufficient for memory formation.},

This is just one example among several human-oriented services which are strongly affected by human activity patterns. Recent empirical evidence is indicating that human activity patterns are characterized by power-law distributions of inter-event times, where large fluctuations rather than regularity is the common case. I show that this temporal heterogeneity can be explained by two mechanisms: (i) humans have some perception of their past activity rate and (ii) based on that they react by accelerating or reducing their activity rate. Using these two mechanisms I explain the inter-event time statistics of Darwin's and Einstein's correspondence and the email activity within an university environment. Moreover, they are typical examples of the accelerating and reducing class, respectively. These results are relevant to the system design of human-oriented services. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion is a common property of all synapses. To trace the origin of spontaneously fused vesicles in hippocampal synapses, we tagged vesicles with fluorescent styryl dyes, antibodies against synaptotagmin-1, or horseradish peroxidase. We could show that synaptic vesicles recycle at rest, and after spontaneous exo-endocytosis, they populate a reluctantly releasable pool of limited size. Interestingly, vesicles in this spontaneously labeled pool were more likely to re-fuse spontaneously compared to vesicles labeled with activity. We found that blocking vesicle refilling at rest selectively depleted neurotransmitter from spontaneously fusing vesicles without significantly altering evoked transmission. Furthermore, in the absence of the vesicle SNARE protein synaptobrevin (VAMP), activity-dependent and spontaneously recycling vesicles could mix, suggesting a role for synaptobrevin in the separation of the two pools. Taken together these results suggest that spontaneously recycling vesicles and activity-dependent recycling vesicles originate from distinct pools with limited cross-talk with each other.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mechanisms of anesthetic-mediated presynaptic inhibition are incompletely understood. Isoflurane reduces presynaptic excitability at the larval Drosophila neuromuscular junction, slowing conduction velocity and depressing glutamate release. Mutations in the Para voltage-gated Na channel enhance anesthetic sensitivity of adult flies. Here, the author examines the role of para in anesthetic sensitivity and seeks to identify the conductance underlying presynaptic inhibition at this synapse. METHODS: Neuromuscular transmission was studied using a two-electrode voltage clamp, with isoflurane applied in physiologic saline. The relation between ionic conductances and presynaptic function was modeled in the Neuron Simulation Environment. Motoneuron ionic currents were monitored via whole cell recordings. RESULTS: Presynaptic inhibition by isoflurane was enhanced significantly in para mutants. Computer simulations of presynaptic actions of anesthetics indicated that each candidate target conductance would have diagnostic effects on the relation between latency and amplitude of synaptic currents. The experimental latency-amplitude relation for isoflurane most closely resembled activation of a simulated hyperpolarizing leak. Simulations indicated that increased isoflurane potency in para axons resulted from reduced excitability of mutant axons. In whole cell recordings, isoflurane activated a hyperpolarizing leak current. The effects of isoflurane at the neuromuscular junction were insensitive to low pH. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of isoflurane on presynaptic excitability are mediated via an acid-insensitive inhibitory leak conductance. para mutations enhance the sensitivity of this anesthetic-modulated neural pathway by reducing axonal excitability. This work provides a link between anesthetic-sensitive leak currents and presynaptic function and has generated new tools for analysis of the function of this synapse.},

Realizations of Levy flights in physical phenomena are very diverse, examples including fluid dynamics, dynamical systems, and micelles(1,2). This diversity raises the possibility that Levy flights may be found in biological systems. A decade ago, it was proposed that Levy flights may be observed in the behaviour of foraging ants(3). Recently, it was argued that Drosophila might perform Levy flights(4), but the hypothesis that foraging animals in natural environments perform Levy flights has not been tested, Here we study the foraging behaviour of the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, and find a power-law distribution of flight-time intervals. We interpret our finding of temporal scale invariance in terms of a scale-invariant spatial distribution of food on the ocean surface. Finally, we examine the significance of our finding in relation to the basis of scale-invariant phenomena observed in biological systems.},

abstract = {Biogenic amines are important signaling molecules in the central nervous system of both vertebrates and invertebrates. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, biogenic amines take part in the regulation of various vital physiological processes such as feeding, learning/memory, locomotion, sexual behavior, and sleep/arousal. Consequently, several morphological studies have analyzed the distribution of aminergic neurons in the CNS. Previous descriptions, however, did not determine the exact spatial location of aminergic neurite arborizations within the neuropil. The release sites and pre-/postsynaptic compartments of aminergic neurons also remained largely unidentified. We here used gal4-driven marker gene expression and immunocytochemistry to map presumed serotonergic (5-HT), dopaminergic, and tyraminergic/octopaminergic neurons in the thoracic and abdominal neuromeres of the Drosophila larval ventral ganglion relying on Fasciclin2-immunoreactive tracts as three-dimensional landmarks. With tyrosine hydroxylase- (TH) or tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (TDC2)-specific gal4-drivers, we also analyzed the distribution of ectopically expressed neuronal compartment markers in presumptive dopaminergic TH and tyraminergic/octopaminergic TDC2 neurons, respectively. Our results suggest that thoracic and abdominal 5-HT and TH neurons are exclusively interneurons whereas most TDC2 neurons are efferent. 5-HT and TH neurons are ideally positioned to integrate sensory information and to modulate neuronal transmission within the ventral ganglion, while most TDC2 neurons appear to act peripherally. In contrast to 5-HT neurons, TH and TDC2 neurons each comprise morphologically different neuron subsets with separated in- and output compartments in specific neuropil regions. The three-dimensional mapping of aminergic neurons now facilitates the identification of neuronal network contacts and co-localized signaling molecules, as exemplified for DOPA decarboxylase-synthesizing neurons that co-express crustacean cardioactive peptide and myoinhibiting peptides.},

abstract = {The larval muscle fibers of Drosophila show four outward K+ currents in addition to the inward Ca2+ current in voltage-clamp recordings. The Shaker (Sh) and the slowpoke (slo) mutations, respectively, eliminate the voltage-activated fast K+ current (IA) and the Ca2(+)-activated fast K+ current (ICF). Quinidine specifically blocks the voltage-activated delayed K+ current (IK) at micromolar concentrations. We used Sh, slo and quinidine to remove specifically one or more K+ currents, so as to study physiological properties of these currents not previously characterized, and to examine their role in membrane excitability. A linear relationship was observed between the peak ICF and the peak ICa at different membrane potentials. ICF inactivated considerably during a 140 ms pulse to +20 mV. Recovery from inactivation was not complete for up to 2 s at the holding potential of -50 mV, which is much slower than the recovery of Ca2+ current from inactivation. In addition to IA and ICF, two delayed K+ currents are also observed in these fibers, the voltage-activated IK and the Ca2(+)-activated ICS. Near the end of a 500 ms depolarizing pulse, both IA and ICF are inactivated. Ca2(+)-free and 20 mmol l-1 Ca2+ saline were used to examine the tail currents of the remaining IK and ICS. The tail currents of ICS were slower than those of IK and reversed between -30 and -50 mV in different fibers. We further studied the dose-dependence of the blockade of IK by quinidine, which did not indicate a simple one-to-one binding mechanism. Current-clamp recordings from normal, Sh, slo and the double-mutant Sh;slo fibers suggested that ICF plays a stronger role than IA in repolarization of the larval muscle membrane. Elimination of ICF facilitates the occurrence of action potentials. Further elimination of IK prolonged the action potentials to several hundred milliseconds.},

abstract = {Animals must be able to find and evaluate food to ensure survival. The ability to associate a cue with the presence of food is advantageous because it allows an animal to quickly identify a situation associated with a good, bad, or even harmful food. Identifying genes underlying these natural learned responses is essential to understanding this ability. Here, we investigate whether natural variation in the foraging (for) gene in Drosophila melanogaster larvae is important in mediating associations between either an odor or a light stimulus and food reward. We found that for influences olfactory conditioning and that the mushroom bodies play a role in this for-mediated olfactory learning. Genotypes associated with high activity of the product of for, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), showed greater memory acquisition and retention compared with genotypes associated with low activity of PKG when trained with three conditioning trials. Interestingly, increasing the number of training trials resulted in decreased memory retention only in genotypes associated with high PKG activity. The difference in the dynamics of memory acquisition and retention between variants of for suggests that the ability to learn and retain an association may be linked to the foraging strategies of the two variants.},

abstract = {The cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) has many cellular functions in vertebrates and insects that affect complex behaviors such as locomotion and foraging. The foraging (for) gene encodes a PKG in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we demonstrate a function for the for gene in sensory responsiveness and nonassociative learning. Larvae of the natural variant sitter (fors) show less locomotor activity during feeding and have a lower PKG activity than rover (forR) larvae. We used rover and sitter adult flies to test whether PKG activity affects (1) responsiveness to sucrose stimuli applied to the front tarsi, and (2) habituation of proboscis extension after repeated sucrose stimulation. To determine whether the differences observed resulted from variation in the for gene, we also tested fors2, a sitter mutant produced on a rover genetic background. We found that rovers (forR) were more responsive to sucrose than sitters (fors and fors2) at 1-, 2-, and 3-wk old. This was true for both sexes. Differences in sucrose responsiveness between rovers and sitters were greater after 2 h of food deprivation than after 24 h. Of flies with similar sucrose responsiveness, forR rovers showed less habituation and generalization of habituation than fors and fors2 sitters. These results show that the PKG encoded by for independently affects sensory responsiveness and habituation in Drosophila melanogaster.},

abstract = {The role played by the unconventional messenger Nitric Oxide (NO) upon the sleep-wake cycle remains controversial. Evidence suggests a positive role of NO on Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) and Paradoxical Sleep (PS) regulation, favoring sleep. However, other studies have found a role of NO upon wakefulness and alertness, inhibiting sleep. Divergences have been explained in part because of the use of different inhibitors of nitric oxide synthases (NOS). The aim of this study is to analyse the effects of a highly selective neuronal NOS inhibitor (3-Bromo7-Nitroindazole) on sleep-wake states in rats. Male Wistar rats were stereotaxically prepared for polysomnography. 3-Bromo-7-Nitroindazole (10, 20, 40 mg/kg, i.p.) dissolved in DMSO 10\% filled with saline, or vehicle (DMSO 10\% in saline) was administered at the beginning of the light period. Three hours of polygraphic recordings were evaluated for stages of vigilance. Results show dose-dependent effects of 3-Bromo7-Nitroindazole upon sleep: 10 mg/kg decreases duration and number of episodes of deep SWS, increasing duration of light SWS. 20 mg/kg decreased duration of light and deep SWS, while active and quiet wake increased. Deep SWS and PS latency increased. Number of episodes of PS decreased, as well as number of cycles of sleep and time spent asleep. 40 mg/kg reduced duration of deep SWS and increased mean episode duration of light SWS. Therefore, sleep states are affected by selective inhibition of nNOS, reducing in all cases deep SWS. These results support the hypothesis that nitric oxide, produced by nNOS, is involved in sleep processes, favoring sleep. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Dopamine is a major neuromodulator in both vertebrates and invertebrates and has profound effects on many physiological processes, including the regulation of attention. Most studies of the functions of dopamine use models with long-term blockade of dopamine release and few effects of transient blockade have yet been reported. The goal of the present study was to determine the role of dopamine in attention-like behavior in Drosophila by taking advantage of the fly's orientation behavior during flight. The examination of several different transgenic flies in a single-target visual attention paradigm showed that flies lost their orientation ability if dopamine release was blocked from the beginning of the development of dopaminergic neurons. This is similar to the attention loss in mammals. However, if the blockade of dopamine release was induced during the experimental procedure, flies performed normally. Statistical analysis of the behavioral assessment showed a significant difference between long-term and transient blockade. Using the RNA interference approach, we generated flies with down-regulated J-domain protein, which is a potential cochaperone in synaptic vesicle release, to make an alternative form of long-term dopamine-blockade mutant. Behavioral assays revealed that flies with permanent J-domain protein down-regulation specifically in dopaminergic neurons have an attention defect similar to that induced by long-term blockade of dopamine release. Furthermore, dopamine depletion beginning at eclosion also caused an attention deficit. Our results indicate that prolonged but not transient blockade of dopamine release impairs visual attention-like behavior in Drosophila.},

abstract = {Digital preservation can encompass a range of activities, from simple replication and storage to more complex transformation, depending on the assessed value and risk to the target content. These activities require planning and, in most cases, begin with a need to know the technical format of the target content. In this case, the target is the content deposited in institutional repositories (IRs). The Preserv project 1 set out to investigate the use of The National Archives' (TNA) PRONOM-DROID service (PRONOM is the online registry of technical information; DROID is the downloadable file format identification tool) for file format identification on two pilot IRs using EPrints software, and instead produced format profiles (Preserv profiles) of over 200 repositories presented via the Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR). Thus a primary element of preservation planning has been shown to be possible based on a standard Web interface (OAI) and no formal arrangement between repository and provider. The implications of this go beyond the numbers towards a reconceptualisation of repository preservation service provider models. Repositories and providers can shape preservation services at different cost levels that could range from comprehensive 'black-box' preservation to pick-and-mix lightweight Web-based services that build on the common starting point, format identification. This article describes the evolution of a series of models that have informed progress towards this conception of flexible and distributed preservation services for IRs.},

abstract = {The hormonal regulation of feeding behaviour is well known in vertebrates, whereas it remains poorly understood in insects. Here, we report that the takeout gene is an essential component of nutritional homeostasis in Drosophila. takeout encodes a putative juvenile hormone (JH) binding protein and has been described as a link between circadian rhythm and feeding behaviour. However, the physiological role of takeout and its putative link to JH remain unknown. In this study, we show that takeout (to(1)) flies failed to adapt their food intake according to food availability and that most defects could be genetically rescued. When food is abundant, to(1) are hyperphagic, yielding to hypertrophy of the fat body. When food reappears after a starvation period, to(1) flies do not increase their food intake as much as wild-type flies. This defect in food intake regulation is partly based on the action of Takeout on taste neurons, because the sensitivity of to(1) gustatory neurons to sugars does not increase after starvation, as in wild-type neurons. This lack of regulation is also evident at the locomotor activity, which normally increases during starvation, a behaviour related to food foraging. In addition, to(1) flies lack sexual dimorphism of locomotor activity, which has previously been linked to the JH circulating level. Moreover, application of the JH analog methoprene rescues the phenotype. These results suggest that takeout plays a central role as a feeding regulator and may act by modulating the circulating JH level.},

@article{BenRokia-Mille2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The skills used by winged insects to explore their environment are strongly dependent upon the integration of neurosensory information comprising visual, acoustic and olfactory signals. The neuronal architecture of the wing contains a vast array of different sensors which might convey information to the brain in order to guide the trajectories during flight. In Drosophila, the wing sensory cells are either chemoreceptors or mechanoreceptors and some of these sensors have as yet unknown functions. The axons of these two functionally distinct types of neurons are entangled, generating a single nerve. This simple and accessible coincidental signaling circuitry in Drosophila constitutes an excellent model system to investigate the developmental variability in relation to natural behavioral polymorphisms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A fluorescent marker was generated in neurons at all stages of the Drosophila life cycle using a highly efficient and controlled genetic recombination system that can be induced in dividing precursor cells (MARCM system, flybase web site). It allows fluorescent signals in axons only when the neuroblasts and/or neuronal cell precursors like SOP (sensory organ precursors) undergo division during the precedent steps. We first show that a robust neurogenesis continues in the wing after the adults emerge from the pupae followed by an extensive axonal growth. Arguments are presented to suggest that this wing neurogenesis in the newborn adult flies was influenced by genetic determinants such as the frequency dependent for gene and by environmental cues such as population density. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the neuronal architecture in the adult Drosophila wing is unfinished when the flies emerge from their pupae. This unexpected developmental step might be crucial for generating non-heritable variants and phenotypic plasticity. This might therefore constitute an advantage in an unstable ecological system and explain much regarding the ability of Drosophila to robustly adapt to their environment.},

This is just one example among several human-oriented services which are strongly affected by human activity patterns. Recent empirical evidence is indicating that human activity patterns are characterized by power-law distributions of inter-event times, where large fluctuations rather than regularity is the common case. I show that this temporal heterogeneity can be explained by two mechanisms: (i) humans have some perception of their past activity rate and (ii) based on that they react by accelerating or reducing their activity rate. Using these two mechanisms I explain the inter-event time statistics of Darwin's and Einstein's correspondence and the email activity within an university environment. Moreover, they are typical examples of the accelerating and reducing class, respectively. These results are relevant to the system design of human-oriented services. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the genetic architecture of behavioral traits begins with identifying the genes regulating these traits, mapping the subset of genetically varying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in natural populations, and pinpointing the molecular polymorphisms defining QTL alleles. Drosophila brings an impressive toolkit to the challenge of genetically dissecting complex traits: P transposable element mutagenesis to identify genes regulating these traits; artificial selection from natural populations to create extreme trait phenotypes; high resolution mapping to identify positional candidate genes corresponding to QTLs; linkage disequilibrium mapping to identify molecular polymorphism(s) that functionally define QTL alleles; and whole genome transcriptional profiling to postulate networks of interacting genes affecting complex traits. Studies in Drosophila have revealed large numbers of pleiotropic genes that interact epistatically to regulate behavioral traits, and that can have sex- and environment-specific effects.

Specifically, Punch (Pu) and pale (ple) mutants with reduced dopamine synthesis show ectopic/aberrant migration, while Catecholamines up (Catsup) mutants that over-express dopamine show a characteristic loss of migration phenotype. We also demonstrate expression of Punch, Ple, Catsup and dopamine in tracheal cells. The dopamine pathway mutant phenotypes can be reproduced by pharmacological treatments of dopamine and a pathway inhibitor 3-iodotyrosine (3-IT), implicating dopamine as a direct mediator of the regulatory function. Furthermore, we show that these mutants genetically interact with components of the endocytic pathway, namely shibire/dynamin and awd/nm23, that promote endocytosis of the chemotactic signaling receptor Btl/FGFR. Consistent with the genetic results, the surface and total cellular levels of a Btl-GFP fusion protein in the tracheal cells and in cultured S2 cells are reduced upon dopamine treatment, and increased in the presence of 3-IT. Moreover, the transducer of Btl signaling, MAP kinase, is hyper-activated throughout the tracheal tube in the Pu mutant. Finally we show that dopamine regulates endocytosis via controlling the dynamin protein level. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Dopamine is a mediator of the stimulant properties of drugs of abuse, including ethanol, in mammals and in the fruit fly Drosophila. The neural substrates for the stimulant actions of ethanol in flies are not known. We show that a subset of dopamine neurons and their targets, through the action of the D1-like dopamine receptor DopR, promote locomotor activation in response to acute ethanol exposure. A bilateral pair of dopaminergic neurons in the fly brain mediates the enhanced locomotor activity induced by ethanol exposure, and promotes locomotion when directly activated. These neurons project to the central complex ellipsoid body, a structure implicated in regulating motor behaviors. Ellipsoid body neurons are required for ethanol-induced locomotor activity and they express DopR. Elimination of DopR blunts the locomotor activating effects of ethanol, and this behavior can be restored by selective expression of DopR in the ellipsoid body. These data tie the activity of defined dopamine neurons to D1-like DopR-expressing neurons to form a neural circuit that governs acute responding to ethanol.},

HCN channels underlie the hyperpolarization-activated current, Ih, an important regulator of excitability and rhythmicity through control of basic membrane properties. Ih is present in multiple neuronal types and regions of the central nervous system, and changes in Ih alter cellular input-output properties and neuronal circuitry important for behavior such as learning and memory. Furthermore, the pathophysiology of neurological diseases of both the central and peripheral nervous system involves defects in excitability, rhythmicity, and signaling, and animal models of many of these disorders have implicated changes in HCN channels and Ih as critical for pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on recent research elucidating the role of HCN channels and Ih in behavior and disease. These studies have utilized knockout mice as well as animal models of disease to examine how Ih may be important in regulating learning and memory, sleep, and consciousness, as well as how misregulation of Ih may contribute to epilepsy, chronic pain, and other neurological disorders.

abstract = {In natural environments where food abundance and quality can change drastically over time, animals must continuously alter their food acquisition strategies. Although genetic variation contributes to this plasticity, the specific genes involved and their interactions with the environment are poorly understood. Here we report that natural variation in the Drosophila gene, foraging (for), which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), affects larval food acquisition in an environmentally dependent fashion. When food is plentiful, the wild-type rover (for(R)) allele confers lower food intake and higher glucose absorption than both the wild-type sitter (for(s)) allele and the mutant for(s2) allele. When food is scarce, for(R), for(s) and for(s2) larvae increase food intake to a common maximal level, but for(R) larvae retain their increased absorption efficiency. Changes in for expression can induce corrective behavioral modifications in response to food deprivation. When reared in environments with low food levels, for(R) larvae have higher survivorship and faster development than for(s) and for(s2) larvae. Together, these results show that natural variation in for has far reaching implications affecting a suite of phenotypes involved in the regulation of food acquisition.},

abstract = {Rhythmic movements, such as peristaltic contraction, are initiated by output from central pattern generator (CPG) networks in the CNS. These oscillatory networks elicit locomotion in the absence of external sensory or descending inputs, but CPG circuits produce more directed and behaviorally relevant movement via peripheral nervous system (PNS) input. Drosophila melanogaster larval locomotion results from patterned muscle contractions moving stereotypically along the body segments, but without PNS feedback, contraction of body segments is uncoordinated. We have dissected the role of a subset of mechanosensory neurons in the larval PNS, the chordotonal organs (chos), in providing sensory feedback to the locomotor CPG circuit with dias (Dynamic Image Analysis System) software. We analyzed mutants carrying cho mutations including atonal, a cho proneural gene, beethoven, a cho cilia class mutant, smetana and touch-insensitive larva B, two axonemal mutants, and 5D10, a weak cho mutant. All cho mutants have defects in gross path morphology compared to controls. These mutants exhibit increased frequency and duration of turning (decision-making) and reduced duration of linear locomotion. Furthermore, cho mutants affect locomotor parameters, including reduced average speed, direction change, and persistence. Dias analysis of peristaltic waves indicates that mutants exhibit reduced average speed, positive flow and negative flow, and increased stride period. Thus, cho sensilla are major proprioceptive components that underlie touch sensitivity, locomotion, and peristaltic contraction by providing sensory feedback to the locomotor CPG circuit in larvae.},

abstract = {The functions of sleep are still unknown, but are probably related to cellular and molecular aspects of neural function. To better understand the benefits that sleep may bring at the cellular level, recent studies have employed Drosophila melanogaster as a model system and shown that fruit flies share the fundamental features of mammalian sleep. As in mammals, sleep in Drosophila is characterized by increased arousal threshold and by changes in brain electrical activity. Fly sleep is homeostatically regulated independent of the circadian clock, is modulated by stimulants and hypnotics, and is affected by age. Also, fly sleep is associated with changes in brain gene expression similar to those observed in mammals. While Drosophila neurobiology is sufficiently complex to permit meaningful generalizations to mammals and humans, Drosophila genetics is simple enough to allow a rapid mutagenesis screening. An ongoing mutagenesis study has screened approximately 5000 mutant Drosophila lines and found that sleep amount, sleep pattern, and the homeostatic regulation of sleep are highly conserved phenotypes in flies. So far, this study has identified 10 short sleeper lines and 4 lines that show no sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. Ultimately, the characterization of these lines should help identifying crucial cellular pathways involved in the regulatory mechanisms of sleep and its functional consequences.},

We performed genetic and pharmacological dissections for presynaptic actions of K+ channels in Drosophila neuromuscular transmission by using electrophysiological and optical imaging techniques. Current understanding of the roles of the Shab IK channel and its mammalian Kv2 counterparts is relatively poor, as compared with that for Shaker IA channels and their Kv1 homologues. Our results revealed the striking effect of Shab mutations during high-frequency synaptic activity, as well as a functional division in synaptic regulation between the Shaker and Shab channels. Shaker channels control the basal level of release, indicated by a response to single nerve stimulation, whereas Shab channels regulate repetitive synaptic activities. These observations highlight the crucial control of nerve terminal excitability by Shaker and Shab channels to confer temporal patterns of synaptic transmission and suggest the potential participation of these channels, along with the transmitter release machinery, in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.},

In addition to the lack of practical literature on subject repositories, registries, software, publishers, and database thesauri do not define subject repositories consistently, do not recognize subject repositories as distinct from other types of repositories, or do not recognize subject repositories at all. At the same time, subject repositories are frequently cited as highly successful scholarly communication initiatives, especially in relation to institutional repositories. The lack of subject repository recognition within the literature and among commonly used repository tools may be attributed to the isolated development of the largest subject repositories and a general lack of awareness about small-scale subject repositories. The authors recommend an increase of literature and research on subject repositories, development of standard language, guidelines, and best practices, and the formation of a community of subject repository professionals.},

During learning, neural responses to reward in these neurons waned and responses to cues that predicted reward emerged. Notably, this cue-evoked activity varied with size and delay. Moreover, when rats were given a choice between two differently valued outcomes, the activity of the neurons initially reflected the more valuable option, even when it was not subsequently selected.},

abstract = {1. Aggregation pheromones can evolve when individuals benefit from clustering. Such a situation can arise with an Allee effect, i.e. a positive relationship between individual fitness and density of conspecifics. Aggregation pheromone in Drosophila induces aggregated oviposition. The aim of the work reported here was to identify an Allee effect in the larval resource exploitation by Drosophila melanogaster , which could explain the evolution of aggregation pheromone in this species. 2. It is hypothesised that an Allee effect in D. melanogaster larvae arises from an increased efficiency of a group of larvae to temper fungal growth on their feeding substrate. To test this hypothesis, standard apple substrates were infested with specified numbers of larvae, and their survival and development were monitored. A potential beneficial effect of the presence of adult flies was also investigated by incubating a varying number of adults on the substrate before introducing the larvae. Adults inoculate substrates with yeast, on which the larvae feed. 3. Fungal growth was related negatively to larval survival and the size of the emerging flies. Although the fungal growth on the substrate was largely reduced at increased larval densities, the measurements of fitness components indicated no Allee effect between larval densities and larval fitness, but rather indicated larval competition. 4. In contrast, increased adult densities on the substrates prior to larval development yielded higher survival of the larvae, larger emerging flies, and also reduced fungal growth on the substrates. Hence, adults enhanced the quality of the larval substrate and significant benefits of aggregated oviposition in fruit flies were shown. Experiments with synthetic pheromone indicated that the aggregation pheromone itself did not contribute directly to the quality of the larval resource. 5. The interaction among adults, micro-organisms, and larval growth is discussed in relation to the consequences for total fitness.},

abstract = {Background: A common feature of memory and its underlying synaptic plasticity is that each can be dissected into short-lived forms involving modification or trafficking of existing proteins and long-term forms that require new gene expression. An underlying assumption of this cellular view of memory consolidation is that these different mechanisms occur within a single neuron. At the neuroanatomical level, however, different temporal stages of memory can engage distinct neural circuits, a notion that has not been conceptually integrated with the cellular view. Results: Here, we investigated this issue in the context of aversive Pavlovian olfactory memory in Drosophila. Previous studies have demonstrated a central role for cAMP signaling in the mushroom body (MB). The Ca2+-responsive adenylyl cyclase RUTABAGA is believed to be a coincidence detector in $\gamma$ neurons, one of the three principle classes of MB Kenyon cells. We were able to separately restore short-term or long-term memory to a rutabaga mutant with expression of rutabaga in different subsets of MB neurons. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a model in which the learning experience initiates two parallel associations: a short-lived trace in MB $\gamma$ neurons, and a long-lived trace in $\alpha$/$\beta$ neurons. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In one case, Drosophila with the rover allele (for(r)) have higher locomotor activity in the presence of food than animals with the sitter allele (for(s)), suggesting a complementary feeding strategy. There are, in addition, differences between for(r) and for(s) Drosophila in some tests of short-term memory (for(r) animals generally perform at higher levels) and thermotolerance (for(s) larvae are more resistant to the effects of high-temperature). We asked whether there could be a direct compensating advantages in adult for(s) flies that could maintain the natural for variants. First, are adult for(s) flies more thermotolerant? Second, do for(r) flies have a higher short-term place memory? Third, as an alternative, might for(s) flies have higher place memory? Our results do not confirm these possibilities. Thus, a thermotolerance advantage of for(s) flies does not compensate for a potential for(r) short-term memory advantage; for(r) flies do not have a universal advantage in short-term memory; and for(s) flies do not have an advantage in place memory that could compensate for for(r) advantages in other learning contexts.},

abstract = {In 2000, Drosophila melanogaster joined the ranks of vertebrates and invertebrates with a defined behavioral sleep state. The characterization of this sleep state revealed striking similarities to sleep in humans: sleep in flies has both circadian and homeostatic components, it is influenced by sex and age, and it is affected by pharmacological agents such as caffeine and antihistamines. As in mammals, arousal thresholds in flies increase with sleep deprivation. Furthermore, changes in brain electrical activity accompany the change from wake to sleep states. Not only do flies and vertebrates share these behavioral and physiological traits of sleep, but they are likely to share at least some genetic mechanisms underlying the regulation of sleep as well. This article reviews the methods currently used to identify and characterize the Drosophila sleep state. As these methods become more refined and our understanding of Drosophila sleep more detailed, the powerful techniques afforded by this organism are likely to unveil deep insights into the function(s) and regulatory mechanisms of sleep.

Shal currents are activated by small EPSPs and modulate post-synaptic potentials, backpropagation of action potentials, and induction of LTP. Fast inactivation of Shal channels regulates the impact of this post-synaptic modulation. Here, we introduce SKIP3, as the first protein interactor of Drosophila Shal K+ channels. The SKIP gene encodes three isoforms with multiple protein-protein interaction domains. SKIP3 is nervous system specific and co-localizes with Shal channels in neuronal cell bodies, and in puncta along processes. Using a genetic deficiency of SKIP, we show that the proportion of neurons displaying a very fast inactivation, consistent with Shal channels exclusively in a "fast" gating mode, is increased in the absence of SKIP3. As a scaffold-like protein, SKIP3 is likely to lead to the identification of a novel regulatory complex that modulates Shal channel inactivation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The deduced product of one gene (DG1; cytological position, 21D) is 14\% larger than the bovine enzyme and differs substantially in sequence at the amino terminus, the region responsible in the bovine enzyme for dimerization. The second gene (DG2; cytological position, 24A) is transcribed into three major RNA species of different size. The largest (DG2; T1) and smallest (DG2;T3) RNAs encode overlapping polypeptides of similar sequence to the whole length of bovine lung cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The translation product of the third major RNA (DG2;T2) lacks sequences similar to those that constitute the dimerization and kinase inhibitory domains of the bovine enzyme. The percentage amino acid identity between DG1 or DG2 and bovine lung cGMP-dependent protein kinase is 55 and 64\%, respectively.

All groups of flies with mushroom body defects show an elevated level of total walking activity. This increase is attributable to the slower and less complete attenuation of activity during the experiment. Walking activity in normal and mushroom body-deficient flies is clustered in active phases (bouts) and rest periods (pauses). Neither the initiation nor the internal structure, but solely the termination of bouts seems to be affected by the mushroom body defects. How this finding relates to the well-documented role of the mushroom bodies in olfactory learning and memory remains to be understood.},

abstract = {Complex as it is, much of the vast network of cellular functions has been success- fully dissected, on a microscopic scale, by the use of mutants in which one element is altered at a time. A similar approach may be fruitful in tackling the complex structures and events underlying behavior, using behavioral mutations to indicate modifications of the nervous system. Drosophila offers the same advantages to such a study as it did to classical genetics, namely, large numbers and short generation time, to which may now be added an enormous store of accumulated knowledge concerning the organism. Containing about 105 neurons, the fly's nervous system is roughly halfway, on a logarithmic scale, between a single neuron and the human brain, and the fly is possessed of a rich repertoire of behavior. The considerable literature on Drosophila behavior since Carpenter's 1905 paper' has recently been re- viewed by Manning.2 Multiple T-mazes and related devices have been used to fractionate populations according to their geotactic or phototactic responses, or spontaneous activity.3 This was pioneered by Hirsch and his colleagues,3 who started with a genetically heterogeneous pool obtained by mixing diverse wild strains and showed that pro- gressive selection yields strains showing hereditary changes in behavior. Such selection depends upon the recombination and additive effects of multiple genes that can prove quite difficult to disentangle. Since it is now possible to produce very high mutation rates in Drosophila, one can, instead, use an inbred strain and isolate mutants in which a behavioral change occurs by a single step, so that direct relationships between individual genes and the nervous system may be investigated. The method described here for fractionating populations is analogous to counter- current distribution,7 an eminently effective method of separating molecules from a mixture by their partition between two solvent phases. Using, instead, the relative preference of an organism for two behavioral alternatives, one obtains rapid, simultaneous measurements on many subjects. The present paper describes the procedure and the isolation of mutants showing changes in phototactic behavior.},

abstract = {During their trajectories in still air, fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) explore their landscape using a series of straight flight paths punctuated by rapid 90 degrees body-saccades [1]. Some saccades are triggered by visual expansion associated with collision avoidance. Yet many saccades are not triggered by visual cues, but rather appear spontaneously. Our analysis reveals that the control of these visually independent saccades and the flight intervals between them constitute an optimal scale-free active searching strategy. Two characteristics of mathematical optimality that are apparent during free-flight in Drosophila are inter-saccade interval lengths distributed according to an inverse square law, which does not vary across landscape scale, and 90 degrees saccade angles, which increase the likelihood that territory will be revisited and thereby reduce the likelihood that near-by targets will be missed. We also show that searching is intermittent, such that active searching phases randomly alternate with relocation phases. Behaviorally, this intermittency is reflected in frequently occurring short, slow speed inter-saccade intervals randomly alternating with rarer, longer, faster inter-saccade intervals. Searching patterns that scale similarly across orders of magnitude of length (i.e., scale-free) have been revealed in animals as diverse as microzooplankton, bumblebees, albatrosses, and spider monkeys, but these do not appear to be optimised with respect to turning angle, whereas Drosophila free-flight search does. Also, intermittent searching patterns, such as those reported here for Drosophila, have been observed in foragers such as planktivorous fish and ground foraging birds. Our results with freely flying Drosophila may constitute the first reported example of searching behaviour that is both scale-free and intermittent.},

abstract = {Recent work in experimental neurophysiology has identified distinct neuronal populations in the rodent brain stem and hypothalamus that selectively promote wake and sleep. Mutual inhibition between these cell groups has suggested the conceptual model of a sleep-wake switch that controls transitions between wake and sleep while minimizing time spent in intermediate states. By combining wake- and sleep-active populations with populations governing transitions between different stages of sleep, a "sleep-wake network" of neuronal populations may be defined. To better understand the dynamics inherent in this network, we created a model sleep-wake network composed of coupled relaxation oscillation equations. Mathematical analysis of the deterministic model provides insight into the dynamics underlying state transitions and predicts mechanisms for each transition type. With the addition of noise, the simulated sleep-wake behavior generated by the model reproduces many qualitative and quantitative features of mouse sleep-wake behavior. In particular, the existence of simulated brief awakenings is a unique feature of the model. In addition to capturing the experimentally observed qualitative difference between brief and sustained wake bouts, the model suggests distinct network mechanisms for the two types of wakefulness. Because circadian and other factors alter the fine architecture of sleep-wake behavior, this model provides a novel framework to explore dynamical principles that may underlie normal and pathologic sleep-wake physiology.},

Imp13 is expressed in and around nuclei of both neurons and muscles. At the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), imp13 affects muscle growth and formation of the subsynaptic reticulum without influencing any presynaptic structural features. In the absence of imp13, the probability of release of neurotransmitter and quantal content is increased, yet the abundance of the postsynaptic receptors and the amplitude of miniature excitatory junctional potentials are not affected. Interestingly, imp13 is required in the muscles to control presynaptic release. Thus, imp13 is a novel factor that affects neurotransmitter release at the fly NMJ. Its role in the context of synaptic homeostasis is discussed.},

abstract = {Successful foraging is necessary for procurement of nutritional resources essential for an animal's survival. Maintenance of foraging and food acquisition is dependent on the ability to balance food intake and energy expenditure. This review examines the role of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) as a regulator of foraging behaviour, food acquisition, and energy balance. The role of PKG in food-related behaviours is highly conserved among worms, flies, bees, ants, and mammals. A growing body of literature suggests that PKG plays an integral role in the component behaviours and physiologies underlying foraging behaviour. These include energy acquisition, nutrient absorption, nutrient allocation, nutrient storage, and energy use. New evidence suggests that PKG mediates both neural and physiological mechanisms underlying these processes. This review illustrates how investigating the role of PKG in energy homeostasis in a diversity of organisms can offer a broad perspective on the mechanisms mediating energy balance.},

abstract = {Coordination of rhythmic locomotion depends upon a precisely balanced interplay between central and peripheral control mechanisms [1]. Although poorly understood, peripheral proprioceptive mechanosensory input is thought to provide information about body position for moment-to-moment modifications of central mechanisms mediating rhythmic motor output [2]. Pickpocket1 (PPK1) is a Drosophila subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) family displaying limited expression in multiple dendritic (md) sensory neurons tiling the larval body wall and a small number of bipolar neurons in the upper brain [3]. ppk1 null mutant larvae had normal external touch sensation and md neuron morphology but displayed striking alterations in crawling behavior. Loss of PPK1 function caused an increase in crawling speed and an unusual straight path with decreased stops and turns relative to wild-type. This enhanced locomotion resulted from sustained peristaltic contraction wave cycling at higher frequency with a significant decrease in pause period between contraction cycles. The mutant phenotype was rescued by a wild-type PPK1 transgene and duplicated by expressing a ppk1RNAi transgene or a dominant-negative PPK1 isoform. These results demonstrate that the PPK1 channel plays an essential role in controlling rhythmic locomotion and provide a powerful genetic model system for further analysis of central and peripheral control mechanisms and their role in movement disorders.},

abstract = {Neuroligins belong to a highly conserved family of cell adhesion molecules that have been implicated in synapse formation and function. However, the precise in vivo roles of Neuroligins remain unclear. In the present study, we have analyzed the function of Drosophila neuroligin 2 (dnl2) in synaptic development and function. We show that dnl2 is strongly expressed in the embryonic and larval CNS and at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). dnl2 null mutants are viable but display numerous structural defects at the NMJ, including reduced axonal branching and fewer synaptic boutons. dnl2 mutants also show an increase in the number of active zones per bouton but a decrease in the thickness of the subsynaptic reticulum and length of postsynaptic densities. dnl2 mutants also exhibit a decrease in the total glutamate receptor density and a shift in the subunit composition of glutamate receptors in favor of GluRIIA complexes. In addition to the observed defects in synaptic morphology, we also find that dnl2 mutants show increased transmitter release and altered kinetics of stimulus-evoked transmitter release. Importantly, the defects in presynaptic structure, receptor density, and synaptic transmission can be rescued by postsynaptic expression of dnl2. Finally, we show that dnl2 colocalizes and binds to Drosophila neurexin (dnrx) in vivo. However, whereas homozygous mutants for either dnl2 or dnrx are viable, double mutants are lethal and display more severe defects in synaptic morphology. Altogether, our data show that, although dnl2 is not absolutely required for synaptogenesis, it is required postsynaptically for synapse maturation and function.},

abstract = {cAMP analogs and activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin strongly potentiate synaptic transmission at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. These effects are generally attributed to activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Recent reports on crustacean and mammalian synapses have implicated other cAMP-dependent effectors in synaptic potentiation. Drosophila neuromuscular junctions were tested for effects of two known cAMP-dependent effectors: hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-regulated channels (HCNCs) and guanine nucleotide exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac). Forskolin-induced enhancement of synaptic transmission was drastically reduced by a blocker of HCNCs, but not completely eliminated. A specific agonist for Epac modestly enhanced synaptic potentials. This agonist also stabilized their amplitudes in the presence of a blocker of HCNCs. The observations implicate HCNCs and Epac in cAMP-dependent potentiation that does not require cAMP-dependent protein kinase, indicating that additional previously unexplored factors contribute to synaptic plasticity in Drosophila. Genetic and molecular techniques available for Drosophila can be used to define the underlying molecular basis for cAMP-dependent synaptic potentiation.},

abstract = {The authors present a novel paradigm for studying visual responses in Drosophila. An eight-level choice maze was found to reliably segregate fly populations according to their responses to moving stripes displayed on a computer screen. Visual responsiveness was robust in wild-type flies, and performance depended on salience effects such as stimulus color and speed. Analysis of individual fly choices in the maze revealed that stereotypy, or choice persistence, contributed significantly to a strain's performance. On the basis of these observations, the authors bred wild-type flies for divergent visual phenotypes by selecting individual flies displaying extreme stereotypy. Selected flies alternated less often in the sequential choice maze than unselected flies, showing that stereotypy could evolve across generations. The authors found that selection for increased stereotypy impaired flies' responsiveness to competing stimuli in tests for attention-like behavior in the maze. Visual selective attention was further investigated by electrophysiology, and it was found that increased stereotypy also impaired responsiveness to competing stimuli at the level of brain activity. Combined results present a comprehensive approach to studying visual responses in Drosophila, and show that behavioral performance involves attention-like processes that are variable among individuals and thus sensitive to artificial selection.},

abstract = {Narcolepsy, a disorder characterized by fragmented bouts of sleep and wakefulness during the day and night as well as cataplexy, has been linked in humans and nonhuman animals to the functional integrity of the orexinergic system. Adult orexin knockout mice and dogs with a mutation of the orexin receptor exhibit symptoms that mirror those seen in narcoleptic humans. As with narcolepsy, infant sleep-wake cycles in humans and rats are highly fragmented, with consolidated bouts of sleep and wakefulness developing gradually. Based on these common features of narcoleptics and infants, we hypothesized that the development of sleep-wake fragmentation in orexin knockout mice would be expressed as a developmental divergence between knockouts and wild-types, with the knockouts lagging behind the wild-types. We tested this hypothesis by recording the sleep-wake patterns of infant orexin knockout and wild-type mice across the first three postnatal weeks. Both knockouts and wild-types exhibited age-dependent, and therefore orexin-independent, quantitative and qualitative changes in sleep-wake patterning. At 3 weeks of age, however, by which time the sleep and wake bouts of the wild-types had consolidated further, the knockouts lagged behind the wild-types and exhibited significantly more bout fragmentation. These findings suggest the possibility that the fragmentation of behavioural states that characterizes narcolepsy in adults reflects reversion back toward the more fragmented sleep-wake patterns that characterize infancy.},

abstract = {Rhythmic movements, such as peristaltic contraction, are initiated by output from central pattern generator (CPG) networks in the CNS. These oscillatory networks elicit locomotion in the absence of external sensory or descending inputs, but CPG circuits produce more directed and behaviorally relevant movement via peripheral nervous system (PNS) input. Drosophila melanogaster larval locomotion results from patterned muscle contractions moving stereotypically along the body segments, but without PNS feedback, contraction of body segments is uncoordinated. We have dissected the role of a subset of mechanosensory neurons in the larval PNS, the chordotonal organs (chos), in providing sensory feedback to the locomotor CPG circuit with dias (Dynamic Image Analysis System) software. We analyzed mutants carrying cho mutations including atonal, a cho proneural gene, beethoven, a cho cilia class mutant, smetana and touch-insensitive larva B, two axonemal mutants, and 5D10, a weak cho mutant. All cho mutants have defects in gross path morphology compared to controls. These mutants exhibit increased frequency and duration of turning (decision-making) and reduced duration of linear locomotion. Furthermore, cho mutants affect locomotor parameters, including reduced average speed, direction change, and persistence. Dias analysis of peristaltic waves indicates that mutants exhibit reduced average speed, positive flow and negative flow, and increased stride period. Thus, cho sensilla are major proprioceptive components that underlie touch sensitivity, locomotion, and peristaltic contraction by providing sensory feedback to the locomotor CPG circuit in larvae.},

Open field studies recently showed that Drosophila avoids central zones and stays at the periphery, an effect that can be interpreted as centrophobism and/or thigmotaxis. In this study, we further characterized this phenomenon and studied the responsible underlying neural mechanisms. The implication of the Drosophila mushroom bodies (MBs) in olfactory learning and memory processes is well documented. In an open field situation in which fly locomotor activity is recorded by video tracking, we show that center avoidance is greatly diminished in flies with hydroxyurea-ablated MBs, suggesting a new role for these structures. Furthermore, the temperature-sensitive allele of the dynamin gene shibire was expressed in various enhancer-trap P[GAL4] lines, disrupting synaptic transmission in different MB lobes. Specifically blocking the gamma lobes alters centrophobism/thigmotaxis while blocking the alpha/beta lobes does not, suggesting a functional specialization of MB lobes. Drosophila may serve as a new model system for elucidating the genetic and neural bases of such complex phenomena as centrophobism/thigmotaxis.},

abstract = {The generation of coordinated body movements relies on sensory feedback from mechanosensitive proprioceptors. We have found that the proper function of NompC, a putative mechanosensitive TRP channel, is not only required for fly locomotion, but also crucial for larval crawling. Calcium imaging revealed that NompC is required for the activation of two subtypes of sensory neurons during peristaltic muscle contractions. Having isolated a full-length nompC cDNA with a protein coding sequence larger than previously predicted, we demonstrate its function by rescuing locomotion defects in nompC mutants, and further show that antibodies against the extended C terminus recognize NompC in chordotonal ciliary tips. Moreover, we show that the ankyrin repeats in NompC are required for proper localization and function of NompC in vivo and are required for association of NompC with microtubules. Taken together, our findings suggest that NompC mediates proprioception in locomotion and support its role as a mechanosensitive channel. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In many animal species, individuals differ consistently in suites of correlated behaviors, comparable with human personalities. Increasing evidence suggests that one of the fundamental factors structuring personality differences is the responsiveness of individuals to environmental stimuli. Whereas some individuals tend to be highly responsive to such stimuli, others are unresponsive and show routine-like behaviors. Much research has focused on the proximate causes of these differences but little is known about their evolutionary origin. Here, we provide an evolutionary explanation. We develop a simple but general evolutionary model that is based on two key ingredients. First, the benefits of responsiveness are frequency-dependent; that is, being responsive is advantageous when rare but disadvantageous when common. This explains why responsive and unresponsive individuals can coexist within a population. Second, positive-feedback mechanisms reduce the costs of responsiveness; that is, responsiveness is less costly for individuals that have been responsive before. This explains why individuals differ consistently in their responsiveness, across contexts and over time. As a result, natural selection gives rise to stable individual differences in responsiveness. Whereas some individuals respond to environmental stimuli in all kinds of contexts, others consistently neglect such stimuli. Interestingly, such differences induce correlations among all kinds of other traits (e.g., boldness and aggressiveness), thus providing an explanation for environment-specific behavioral syndromes.},

Some of these important behavioral phenomena have been dissected with defined mutants, some to a single biochemical lesion, expressed in central brain structures known as the mushroom bodies. A previously introduced preparation used a window in the head capsule through which these structures could be imaged using genetically expressed fluorescent calcium sensors while applying physiological odorant stimuli. Unfortunately, technical constraints prevented direct manipulation of the mushroom bodies with this preparation. I describe here a preparation that will allow, for the first time, the direct pharmacological manipulation of these important structures during imaging in the living adult fly. Responses to discreet applications of acetylcholine were reversibly blocked with tubocurare and reversibly eliminated in calcium-free Ringers. This new technique will significantly enhance the usefulness of the Drosophila model system, allowing a more quantitative examination of the mechanisms involved in olfactory learning and memory. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Biogenic amines are important signaling molecules in the central nervous system of both vertebrates and invertebrates. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, biogenic amines take part in the regulation of various vital physiological processes such as feeding, learning/memory, locomotion, sexual behavior, and sleep/arousal. Consequently, several morphological studies have analyzed the distribution of aminergic neurons in the CNS. Previous descriptions, however, did not determine the exact spatial location of aminergic neurite arborizations within the neuropil. The release sites and pre-/postsynaptic compartments of aminergic neurons also remained largely unidentified. We here used gal4-driven marker gene expression and immunocytochemistry to map presumed serotonergic (5-HT), dopaminergic, and tyraminergic/octopaminergic neurons in the thoracic and abdominal neuromeres of the Drosophila larval ventral ganglion relying on Fasciclin2-immunoreactive tracts as three-dimensional landmarks. With tyrosine hydroxylase- (TH) or tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (TDC2)-specific gal4-drivers, we also analyzed the distribution of ectopically expressed neuronal compartment markers in presumptive dopaminergic TH and tyraminergic/octopaminergic TDC2 neurons, respectively. Our results suggest that thoracic and abdominal 5-HT and TH neurons are exclusively interneurons whereas most TDC2 neurons are efferent. 5-HT and TH neurons are ideally positioned to integrate sensory information and to modulate neuronal transmission within the ventral ganglion, while most TDC2 neurons appear to act peripherally. In contrast to 5-HT neurons, TH and TDC2 neurons each comprise morphologically different neuron subsets with separated in- and output compartments in specific neuropil regions. The three-dimensional mapping of aminergic neurons now facilitates the identification of neuronal network contacts and co-localized signaling molecules, as exemplified for DOPA decarboxylase-synthesizing neurons that co-express crustacean cardioactive peptide and myoinhibiting peptides.},

abstract = {Many aspects of behavior such as aggression, courtship, sexual orientation, and the sleep-wake cycle are determined by specific genes. Although point mutations in these genes predictably change characteristics of behavior, substantial variation can be observed among a population as well as during the lifetime of individuals. The origin of variation in behavior, however, is largely unknown. Here the authors investigated the role of HSP90 for the circadian control of behavior in Drosophila. They found that a partial loss of HSP90 function, either by mutagenesis or by pharmacological inhibition, did not affect the circadian clock itself, but the translation of molecular oscillations into behavioral rhythms. In HSP90-deficient flies behavioral activity was no longer stringently coupled to molecular oscillations giving rise to a large variation in individual behavioral activity patterns. The results show that HSP90 is a potent capacitor of behavioral variation, analogous to its role in morphology. Decreased HSP90 activity not only increases behavioral variability among a population, but interestingly also during the lifetime of individuals.},

Continuing this investigation we studied the effect of the central complex on the temporal structure of spontaneous locomotor activity in the time domain of a few hours. In an attempt to dissect the internal circuitry of the central complex we perturbed a putative local neuronal network connecting the four neuropil regions of the central complex, the protocerebral bridge, the fan-shape body, the noduli and the ellipsoid body. Two independent and non-invasive methods were applied: mutations affecting the neuroarchitecture of the protocerebral bridge, and the targeted expression of tetanus toxin in small subsets of central complex neurons using the binary enhancer trap P[GAL4] system. All groups of flies with a disturbed component of this network exhibited a common phenotype: a drastic decrease in locomotor activity. While locomotor activity was still clustered in bouts and these were initiated at the normal rate, their duration was reduced. This finding suggests that the bridge and some of its neural connections to the other neuropil regions of the central complex are required for the maintenance but not the initiation of walking.},

abstract = {Monoamines such as dopamine, histamine and serotonin (5-HT) are widely distributed throughout the brain of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, where many of their actions have been investigated. For example, histamine is released from photoreceptor synapses in the lamina neuropile of the visual system. Mutations of the genes white, an important eye pigmentation marker in fly genetics that encodes an ABC transporter, and its binding partner brown, cause neural phenotypes not readily reconciled solely with actions in eye pigmentation. We find that flies mutant for these genes, and another binding partner, scarlet, have about half the wild-type amount of histamine in the head, as well as reduced 5-HT and dopamine. These differences parallel reductions in immunoreactivity to the corresponding biogenic amines. They also correlate with the amine content of fractions after differential centrifugation of head homogenates. Thus, most of the amine is found in the vesicle-rich fraction of wild-type head homogenates, whereas it is found in the supernatant fractions from white, brown and scarlet flies. White co-expresses in lamina epithelial glia with Ebony, which conjugates histamine to beta-alanine. Histamine is then released when the conjugate is hydrolyzed in photoreceptors, by Tan. Mutant white ameliorates the effects of tan on head histamine whereas it exacerbates the effects of ebony. Our results are consistent with the proposal that histamine uptake by the epithelial glia may be white dependent. Behavioral abnormalities in white, brown and scarlet mutants could arise because aminergic neurons in the Drosophila brain have reduced amine for release.},

abstract = {In recent years, a number of tools have become available for remotely activating neural circuits in Drosophila. Despite widespread and growing use, very little work has been done to characterize exactly how these tools affect activity in identified fly neurons. Using the GAL4-UAS system, we expressed blue light-gated Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and a mutated form of ChR2 (H134R-ChR2) in motor and sensory neurons of the Drosophila third-instar locomotor circuit. Neurons expressing H134R-ChR2 show enhanced responses to blue light pulses and less spike frequency adaptation than neurons expressing ChR2. Although H134R-ChR2 was more effective at manipulating behavior than ChR2, the behavioral consequences of firing rate adaptation were different in sensory and motor neurons. For comparison, we examined the effects of ectopic expression of the warmth-activated cation channel Drosophila TRPA1 (dTRPA1). When dTRPA1 was expressed in larval motor neurons, heat ramps from 21 to 27 degrees C evoked tonic spiking at approximately 25 degrees C that showed little adaptation over many minutes. dTRPA1 activation had stronger and longer-lasting effects on behavior than ChR2 variants. These results suggest that dTRPA1 may be particularly useful for researchers interested in activating fly neural circuits over long time scales. Overall, this work suggests that understanding the cellular effects of these genetic tools and their temporal dynamics is important for the design and interpretation of behavioral experiments.},

@article{RodriguezMoncalvo2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drosophila larval locomotion consists of forward peristalsis interrupted by episodes of pausing, turning and exploratory behavior (head swinging). This behavior can be regulated by visual input as seen by light-induced increase in pausing, head swinging and direction change as well as reduction of linear speed that characterizes the larval photophobic response. During 3rd instar stage, Drosophila larvae gradually cease to be repelled by light and are photoneutral by the time they wander in search for a place to undergo metamorphosis. Thus, Drosophila larval photobehavior can be used to study control of locomotion. RESULTS: We used targeted neuronal silencing to assess the role of candidate neurons in the regulation of larval photobehavior. Inactivation of DOPA decarboxylase (Ddc) neurons increases the response to light throughout larval development, including during the later stages of the 3rd instar characterized by photoneutral response. Increased response to light is characterized by increase in light-induced direction change and associated pause, and reduction of linear movement. Amongst Ddc neurons, suppression of the activity of corazonergic and serotonergic but not dopaminergic neurons increases the photophobic response observed during 3rd instar stage. Silencing of serotonergic neurons does not disrupt larval locomotion or the response to mechanical stimuli. Reduced serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) signaling within serotonergic neurons recapitulates the results obtained with targeted neuronal silencing. Ablation of serotonergic cells in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) does not affect the larval response to light. Similarly, disruption of serotonergic projections that contact the photoreceptor termini in the brain hemispheres does not impact the larval response to light. Finally, pan-neural over-expression of 5-HT1A Dro receptors, but not of any other 5-HT receptor subtype, causes a significant decrease in the response to light of 3rd instar larvae. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that activity of serotonergic and corazonergic neurons contribute to the control of larval locomotion by light. We conclude that this control is carried out by 5-HT neurons located in the brain hemispheres, but does not appear to occur at the photoreceptor level and may be mediated by 5-HT1A Dro receptors. These findings provide new insights into the function of 5-HT neurons in Drosophila larval behavior as well as into the mechanisms underlying regulation of larval response to light.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder and its pathophysiology is unknown. We hypothesize that increased membrane excitability in motor circuits has a key role in the pathogenesis of ET. Specifically, we propose that neural circuits controlling ballistic movements are inherently unstable due to their underlying reciprocal innervation. Such instability is enhanced by increased neural membrane excitability and the circuit begins to oscillate. These oscillations manifest as tremor. METHODS: Postural limb tremor was recorded in 22 ET patients and then the phenotype was simulated with a conductance-based neuromimetic model of ballistic movements. The model neuron was Hodgkin-Huxley type with added hyperpolarization activated cation current (Ih), low threshold calcium current (IT), and GABA and glycine mediated chloride currents. The neurons also featured the neurophysiological property of rebound excitation after release from sustained inhibition (post-inhibitory rebound). The model featured a reciprocally innervated circuit of neurons that project to agonist and antagonist muscle pairs. RESULTS: Neural excitability was modulated by changing Ih and/or IT. Increasing Ih and/or IT further depolarized the membrane and thus increased excitability. The characteristics of the tremor from all ET patients were simulated when Ih was increased to approximately 10x the range of physiological values. In contrast, increasing other membrane conductances, while keeping Ih at a physiological value, did not simulate the tremor. Increases in Ih and IT determined the frequency and amplitude of the simulated oscillations. CONCLUSION: These simulations support the hypothesis that increased membrane excitability in potentially unstable, reciprocally innervated circuits can produce oscillations that resemble ET. Neural excitability could be increased in a number of ways. In this study membrane excitability was increased by up-regulating Ih and IT. This approach suggests new experimental and clinical ways to understand and treat common tremor disorders.},

abstract = {Sleep is one of the few major whole-organ phenomena for which no function and no underlying mechanism have been conclusively demonstrated. Sleep could result from global changes in the brain during wakefulness or it could be regulated by specific loci that recruit the rest of the brain into the electrical and metabolic states characteristic of sleep. Here we address this issue by exploiting the genetic tractability of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, which exhibits the hallmarks of vertebrate sleep. We show that large changes in sleep are achieved by spatial and temporal enhancement of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity specifically in the adult mushroom bodies of Drosophila. Other manipulations of the mushroom bodies, such as electrical silencing, increasing excitation or ablation, also alter sleep. These results link sleep regulation to an anatomical locus known to be involved in learning and memory.},

abstract = {In Drosophila melanogaster, antennal hearing organs mediate the detection of conspecific songs. Combining laser Doppler vibrometry, acoustic near-field measurements and anatomical analysis, we have investigated the first steps in Drosophila audition, i.e. the conversion of acoustic energy into mechanical vibrations and the subsequent transmission of vibrations to the auditory receptors in the base of the antenna. Examination of the mechanical responses of the antennal structures established that the distal antennal parts (the funiculus and the arista) together constitute a mechanical entity, the sound receiver. Unconventionally, this receiver is asymmetric, resulting in an unusual, rotatory pattern of vibration; in the presence of sound, the arista and the funiculus together rotate about the longitudinal axis of the latter. According to the mechanical response characteristics, the antennal receiver represents a moderately damped simple harmonic oscillator. The receiver's resonance frequency increases continuously with the stimulus intensity, demonstrating the presence of a non-linear stiffness that may be introduced by the auditory sense organ. This surprising, non-linear effect is relevant for close-range acoustic communication in Drosophila; by improving antennal sensitivity at low song intensities and reducing sensitivity when intensity is high, it brings about dynamic range compression in the fly's auditory system.},

abstract = {Synapses are specialized communication points between neurons, and their number is a major determinant of cognitive abilities. These dynamic structures undergo developmental- and activity-dependent changes. During brain aging and certain diseases, synapses are gradually lost, causing mental decline. It is, thus, critical to identify the molecular mechanisms controlling synapse number. We show here that the levels of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) regulate synapse number in both Drosophila larval motor neurons and adult brain projection neurons. The supernumerary synapses induced by PI3K overexpression are functional and elicit changes in behavior. Remarkably, PI3K activation induces synaptogenesis in aged adult neurons as well. We demonstrate that persistent PI3K activity is necessary for synapse maintenance. We also report that PI3K controls the expression and localization of synaptic markers in human neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that PI3K synaptogenic activity is conserved in humans. Thus, we propose that PI3K stimulation can be applied to prevent or delay synapse loss in normal aging and in neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Synapse remodeling is an extremely dynamic process, often regulated by neural activity. Here we show during activity-dependent synaptic growth at the Drosophila NMJ many immature synaptic boutons fail to form stable postsynaptic contacts, are selectively shed from the parent arbor, and degenerate or disappear from the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Surprisingly, we also observe the widespread appearance of presynaptically derived "debris" during normal synaptic growth. The shedding of both immature boutons and presynaptic debris is enhanced by high-frequency stimulation of motorneurons, indicating that their formation is modulated by neural activity. Interestingly, we find that glia dynamically invade the NMJ and, working together with muscle cells, phagocytose shed presynaptic material. Suppressing engulfment activity in glia or muscle by disrupting the Draper/Ced-6 pathway results in a dramatic accumulation of presynaptic debris, and synaptic growth in turn is severely compromised. Thus actively growing NMJ arbors appear to constitutively generate an excessive number of immature boutons, eliminate those that are not stabilized through a shedding process, and normal synaptic expansion requires the continuous clearance of this material by both glia and muscle cells.},

Individuals differed in the number of territorial encounters they participated in and the number they won. The outcome of encounters depended on resident status and, to a lesser extent, body weight. Encounters with escalated fighting were less frequently won by residents than non- escalated encounters, and the success of residents in the former could be accounted for by the body weight asymmetry. A display involving erect wings was more common in escalated encounters, but provided no information on body weight or resident status. Escalation in D. simulans depended on the difference in body weight between winners and losers. D. melanogaster had shorter encounters than D. simulans, and a lower incidence of escalated fighting. Fewer D. melanogaster males participated in territorial defence. Territorial males were more successful in mating than non-territorial males.},

It has been reported that the Drosophila rest/activity cycle has features in common with the mammalian sleep/wake cycle, and it is expected that use of the fly genetic model will facilitate a molecular understanding of sleep and arousal. Here, we report the phenotypic characterization of a Drosophila rest/activity mutant known as fumin (fmn). We show that fmn mutants have abnormally high levels of activity and reduced rest (sleep); genetic mapping, molecular analyses, and phenotypic rescue experiments demonstrate that these phenotypes result from mutation of the Drosophila dopamine transporter gene. Consistent with the rest phenotype, fmn mutants show enhanced sensitivity to mechanical stimuli and a prolonged arousal once active, indicating a decreased arousal threshold. Strikingly,fmn mutants do not show significant rebound in response to rest deprivation as is typical for wild-type flies, nor do they show decreased life span. These results provide direct evidence that dopaminergic signaling has a critical function in the regulation of insect arousal.},

abstract = {In a given population, certain individuals are much more likely to have seizures than others. This increase in seizure susceptibility can lead to spontaneous seizures, such as seen in idiopathic epilepsy, or to symptomatic seizures that occur after insults to the nervous system. Despite the frequency of these seizure disorders in the human population, the genetic and physiological basis for these defects remains unclear. The present study makes use of Drosophila as a potentially powerful model for understanding seizure susceptibility in humans. In addition to the genetic and molecular advantages of using Drosophila, it has been found that seizures in Drosophila share much in common with seizures seen in humans. However, the most powerful aspect of this model lies in the ability to accurately measure seizure susceptibility across genotypes and over time. In the current study seizure susceptibility was quantified in a variety of mutant and wild-type strains, and it was found that genetic mutations can modulate susceptibility over an extremely wide range. This genetic modulation of seizure susceptibility apparently occurs without affecting the threshold of individual neurons. Seizure susceptibility also varied depending on the experience of the fly, decreasing immediately after a seizure and then gradually increasing over time. A novel phenomenon was also identified in which seizures are suppressed after certain high-intensity stimuli. These results demonstrate the utility of Drosophila as a model system for studying human seizure disorders and provide insights into the possible mechanisms by which seizure susceptibility is modified.},

abstract = {Bidirectional trans-synaptic signals induce synaptogenesis and regulate subsequent synaptic maturation. Presynaptically secreted Mind the gap (Mtg) molds the synaptic cleft extracellular matrix, leading us to hypothesize that Mtg functions to generate the intercellular environment required for efficient signaling. We show in Drosophila that secreted Jelly belly (Jeb) and its receptor tyrosine kinase Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) are localized to developing synapses. Jeb localizes to punctate aggregates in central synaptic neuropil and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) presynaptic terminals. Secreted Jeb and Mtg accumulate and colocalize extracellularly in surrounding synaptic boutons. Alk concentrates in postsynaptic domains, consistent with an anterograde, trans-synaptic Jeb-Alk signaling pathway at developing synapses. Jeb synaptic expression is increased in Alk mutants, consistent with a requirement for Alk receptor function in Jeb uptake. In mtg null mutants, Alk NMJ synaptic levels are reduced and Jeb expression is dramatically increased. NMJ synapse morphology and molecular assembly appear largely normal in jeb and Alk mutants, but larvae exhibit greatly reduced movement, suggesting impaired functional synaptic development. jeb mutant movement is significantly rescued by neuronal Jeb expression. jeb and Alk mutants display normal NMJ postsynaptic responses, but a near loss of patterned, activity-dependent NMJ transmission driven by central excitatory output. We conclude that Jeb-Alk expression and anterograde trans-synaptic signaling are modulated by Mtg and play a key role in establishing functional synaptic connectivity in the developing motor circuit.},

Although dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) were previously thought solely to be interneurons, recent studies suggest that dopamine may also act as a neuromodulator in humoral pathways. We examined both application of dopamine on intact larval CNS-segmental preparations and isolated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Dopamine rapidly decreased the rhythmicity of the CNS motor activity. Application of dopamine on neuromuscular preparations of the segmental muscles 6 and 7 resulted in a dose-responsive decrease in the excitatory junction potentials (EJPs). With the use of focal, macro-patch synaptic current recordings the quantal evoked transmission showed a depression of vesicular release at concentrations of 10 microM. Higher concentrations (1 mM) produced a rapid decrement in evoked vesicular release. Dopamine did not alter the shape of the spontaneous synaptic currents, suggesting that dopamine does not alter the postsynaptic muscle fiber receptiveness to the glutaminergic motor nerve transmission. The effects are presynaptic in causing a reduction in the number of vesicles that are stimulated to be released due to neural activity.},

abstract = {Vitamin A is known to be critical for the beginning of eye development as well as for photoreception in the functional retina. Hardly anything, however, is known about whether retinoic acid (RA)-regulated gene expression also plays a role in the long intervening period, during which the neurobiological retinal structure takes shape. The eye contains a highly intricate architecture of RA-synthesizing (RALDH) and degrading (CYP26) enzymes. Whereas the RALDHs are integrated in the early molecular mechanisms through which the dorso-ventral retina organization is established, the CYP26 enzymes are not necessary for this process and no molecular targets that match their retinal expression pattern have yet been identified. In this article we describe that CYP26 expression in the mouse is most distinctive during later stages of retina formation. Throughout development CYP26A1 degrades RA in a horizontal region that extends across the retina, but during later embryonic and postnatal retina maturation this function is reinforced by another enzyme, CYP26C1. RA applications at this stage do not affect the RALDHs but cause differential changes in CYP26 expression: Cyp26a1 is up-regulated, but more rapidly by 9-cis than all-trans RA, Cyp26c1 is down-regulated, and Cyp26b1, which is undetectable in the normal mouse retina, is strongly activated in retinal ganglion cells. The dynamic regulation in RA-difference patterns by the CYP26 enzymes may set up spatial constellations for expression of genes involved in formation of retinal specializations for higher acuity vision, which are known to form over a prolonged period late in retina development.

abstract = {In vertebrates, sialylated glycans participate in a wide range of biological processes and affect the development and function of the nervous system. While the complexity of glycosylation and the functional redundancy among sialyltransferases provide obstacles for revealing biological roles of sialylation in mammals, Drosophila possesses a sole vertebrate-type sialyltransferase, Drosophila sialyltransferase (DSiaT), with significant homology to its mammalian counterparts, suggesting that Drosophila could be a suitable model to investigate the function of sialylation. To explore this possibility and investigate the role of sialylation in Drosophila, we inactivated DSiaT in vivo by gene targeting and analyzed phenotypes of DSiaT mutants using a combination of behavioral, immunolabeling, electrophysiological, and pharmacological approaches. Our experiments demonstrated that DSiaT expression is restricted to a subset of CNS neurons throughout development. We found that DSiaT mutations result in significantly decreased life span, locomotor abnormalities, temperature-sensitive paralysis, and defects of neuromuscular junctions. Our results indicate that DSiaT regulates neuronal excitability and affects the function of a voltage-gated sodium channel. Finally, we showed that sialyltransferase activity is required for DSiaT function in vivo, which suggests that DSiaT mutant phenotypes result from a defect in sialylation of N-glycans. This work provided the first evidence that sialylation has an important biological function in protostomes, while also revealing a novel, nervous system-specific function of alpha2,6-sialylation. Thus, our data shed light on one of the most ancient functions of sialic acids in metazoan organisms and suggest a possibility that this function is evolutionarily conserved between flies and mammals.},

abstract = {The neuromuscular system of Drosophila melanogaster has been studied for many years for its relative simplicity and because of the genetic and molecular versatilities. Three main types of striated muscles are present in this dipteran: fibrillar muscles, tubular muscles and supercontractile muscles. The visceral muscles in adult flies and the body wall segmental muscles in embryos and larvae belong to the group of supercontractile muscles. Larval body wall muscles have been the object of detailed studies as a model for neuromuscular junction function but have received much less attention with respect to their mechanical properties and to the control of contraction. In this review we wish to assess available information on the physiology of the Drosophila larval muscular system. Our aim is to establish whether this system has the requisites to be considered a good model in which to perform a functional characterization of Drosophila genes, with a known muscular expression, as well as Drosophila homologs of human genes, the dysfunction of which, is known to be associated with human hereditary muscle pathologies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In Drosophila, locomotor activity is sexually dimorphic and the brain area controlling this dimorphism has been mapped. The neurons of the pars intercerebralis (PI) have been suggested to participate in such differences between males and females. However, the precise physical nature of the dimorphism, the identity of the PI neurons involved, and the nature of the neuronal signal coding the dimorphism remain unknown. In this study, we used a video-tracking paradigm to characterize further the pattern of locomotor activity in Drosophila. We show that the number of activity/inactivity periods (start/stop bouts) is also sexually dimorphic, and that it can be genetically feminized in males. Moreover, the transplantation of PI neurons from a female, or of feminized PI neurons from a donor male into a receiver wild-type male is sufficient to induce the feminization of locomotor behavior, confirming that this tiny cluster of approximately 10 neurons is directly responsible for the sexual dimorphism in locomotor activity. Finally, feeding males with fluvastatin, a juvenile hormone (JH) inhibitor, also led to start/stop feminization, and this effect is reversible by the simultaneous application of methoprene, a JH analog, suggesting the existence of a neuroendocrine control, by JH, of such behavioral dimorphism.},

abstract = {An important step toward understanding the molecular basis of the functional diversity of pacemaker currents in spontaneously active cells has been the identification of a gene family encoding hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-sensitive cation nonselective (HCN) channels. Three of the four gene products that have been expressed so far give rise to pacemaker channels with distinct activation kinetics and are differentially distributed among the brain, with considerable overlap between some isoforms. This raises the possibility that HCN channels may coassemble to form heteromeric channels in some areas, similar to other K(+) channels. In this study, we have provided evidence for functional heteromerization of HCN1 and HCN2 channels using a concatenated cDNA construct encoding two connected subunits. We have observed that heteromeric channels activate several-fold faster than HCN2 and only a little slower than HCN1. Furthermore, the voltage dependence of activation is more similar to HCN2, whereas the cAMP sensitivity is intermediate between HCN1 and HCN2. This phenotype shows marked similarity to the current arising from coexpressed HCN1 and HCN2 subunits in oocytes and the native pacemaker current in CA1 pyramidal neurons. We suggest that heteromerization may increase the functional diversity beyond the levels expected from the number of HCN channel genes and their differential distribution.},

Activation of a hsp-70/miniwhite (mini-w) transgene in mature males results in a marked change in their sexual behavior such that they begin to vigorously court other mature males. In transformant populations containing equal numbers of both sexes, most males participate, thus forming male-male courtship chains, circles, and lariats. Mutations that ablate the w transgene function also abolish this inducible behavior. Female sexual behavior does not appear to be altered by ectopic w expression. By contrast, when exposed to an active homosexual courtship environment, non-transformant males alter their behavior and actively participate in the male-male chaining. These findings demonstrate that, in Drosophila, both genetic and environmental factors play a role in male sexual behavior.},

abstract = {Patterns of deliberate human activity and behavior are of utmost importance in areas as diverse as disease spread, resource allocation, and emergency response. Because of its widespread availability and use, e-mail correspondence provides an attractive proxy for studying human activity. Recently, it was reported that the probability density for the inter-event time tau between consecutively sent e-mails decays asymptotically as tau(-alpha), with alpha approximately 1. The slower-than-exponential decay of the inter-event time distribution suggests that deliberate human activity is inherently non-Poissonian. Here, we demonstrate that the approximate power-law scaling of the inter-event time distribution is a consequence of circadian and weekly cycles of human activity. We propose a cascading nonhomogeneous Poisson process that explicitly integrates these periodic patterns in activity with an individual's tendency to continue participating in an activity. Using standard statistical techniques, we show that our model is consistent with the empirical data. Our findings may also provide insight into the origins of heavy-tailed distributions in other complex systems.},

abstract = {Studies of neuropeptide and peptide hormone signaling are coming of age in Drosophila due to rapid developments in molecular genetics approaches that overcome the difficulties caused by the small size of the fly. In addition we have genome-wide information on genes involved in peptide signaling, and growing pools of peptidomics data. A large number of different neuropeptides has been identified in a huge variety of neuron types in different parts of the Drosophila nervous system and cells in other locations. This review addresses questions related to peptidergic signaling in the Drosophila nervous system, especially how peptides regulate physiology and behavior during development and in the mature fly. We first summarize novel findings on neuropeptide precursor genes, processed bioactive peptides and their cognate receptors. Thereafter we provide an overview of the physiological and behavioral roles of peptide signaling in Drosophila. These roles include regulation of development, growth, feeding, metabolism, reproduction, homeostasis, and longevity, as well as neuromodulation in learning and memory, olfaction and locomotor control. The substrate of this signaling is the peptide products of about 42 precursor genes expressed in different combinations in a variety of neuronal circuits or that act as circulating hormones. Approximately 45 G-protein-coupled peptide receptors are known in Drosophila and for most of these the ligands have been identified. Functions of some peptides are better understood than others, and much work remains to reveal the spectrum of roles neuropeptides and peptide hormones play in the daily life of a fly. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The honeybee's colony fitness relies on an optimized age-dependent division of labor. Transition from nursing activities to foraging activities is associated with an increase in the expression of the Amfor gene. Ben-Shahar et al. [Ben-Shahar, Y., Robichon, A., Sokolowski, M.B., Robinson, G.E., 2002. Influence of gene action across different time scales on behavior. Science 296, 741-744] showed that the Amfor transcripts and their gene products are involved in regulating the transition from one task to the next. In this study, we investigated the trajectory of the expression of this gene in the brain over time. The expression pattern could contribute to our understanding of the involvement of Amfor in the transition process. Is there a gradual increase in transcript or a peak in expression triggering a downstream path of multiple differential gene expression? Hereto, bees were sampled from colonies containing marked 1-day-old bees every 2 or 3 days around the expected time of transition from nurse to forager, from day 13 to 25. To quantify Amfor transcript in the brain, we developed a real-time RT-PCR assay, based on Taqman?? technology, using fluorescent probes. Results revealed a trigger mechanism rather than a continued elevation of Amfor expression. The appearance of an Amfor expression peak suggests that under normal physiological conditions foraging behavior is, at least in part, due to a trigger-effect of Amfor. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The study of animal foraging behaviour is of practical ecological importance, and exemplifies the wider scientific problem of optimizing search strategies. L\'{e}vy flights are random walks, the step lengths of which come from probability distributions with heavy power-law tails, such that clusters of short steps are connected by rare long steps. L\'{e}vy flights display fractal properties, have no typical scale, and occur in physical and chemical systems. An attempt to demonstrate their existence in a natural biological system presented evidence that wandering albatrosses perform L\'{e}vy flights when searching for prey on the ocean surface. This well known finding was followed by similar inferences about the search strategies of deer and bumblebees. These pioneering studies have triggered much theoretical work in physics (for example, refs 11, 12), as well as empirical ecological analyses regarding reindeer, microzooplankton, grey seals, spider monkeys and fishing boats. Here we analyse a new, high-resolution data set of wandering albatross flights, and find no evidence for L\'{e}vy flight behaviour. Instead we find that flight times are gamma distributed, with an exponential decay for the longest flights. We re-analyse the original albatross data using additional information, and conclude that the extremely long flights, essential for demonstrating L\'{e}vy flight behaviour, were spurious. Furthermore, we propose a widely applicable method to test for power-law distributions using likelihood and Akaike weights. We apply this to the four original deer and bumblebee data sets, finding that none exhibits evidence of L\'{e}vy flights, and that the original graphical approach is insufficient. Such a graphical approach has been adopted to conclude L\'{e}vy flight movement for other organisms, and to propose L\'{e}vy flight analysis as a potential real-time ecosystem monitoring tool. Our results question the strength of the empirical evidence for biological L\'{e}vy flights.},

abstract = {Sleep is present and tightly regulated in every vertebrate species in which it has been carefully investigated, but what sleep is for remains a mystery. Sleep is also present in invertebrates, and an extensive analysis in Drosophila melanogaster has shown that sleep in fruit flies shows most of the fundamental features that characterize sleep in mammals. In Drosophila, sleep consists of sustained periods of quiescence associated with an increased arousal threshold. Fly sleep is modulated by several of the same stimulants and hypnotics that affect mammalian sleep. Moreover, like in mammals, fly sleep shows remarkable interindividual variability. The expression of several genes involved in energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and the response to cellular stress varies in Drosophila between sleep and wakefulness, and the same occurs in rodents. Brain activity also changes in flies as a function of behavioral state. Furthermore, Drosophila sleep is tightly regulated in a circadian and homeostatic manner, and the homeostatic regulation is largely independent of the circadian regulation. After sleep deprivation, recovery sleep in flies is longer in duration and more consolidated, indicated by an increase in arousal threshold and fewer brief awakenings. Finally, sleep deprivation in flies impairs vigilance and performance. Because of the extensive similarities between flies and mammals, Drosophila is now being used as a promising model system for the genetic dissection of sleep. Over the last few years, mutagenesis screens have isolated several short sleeping mutants, a demonstration that single genes can have a powerful effect on a complex trait like sleep.},

abstract = {Genetic causes for disturbances of locomotor behavior can be due to muscle, peripheral neuron, or central nervous system pathologies. The Drosophila melanogaster homolog of human CASK (also known as caki or camguk) is a molecular scaffold that has been postulated to have roles in both locomotion and plasticity. These conclusions are based on studies using overlapping deficiencies that largely eliminate the entire CASK locus, but contain additional chromosomal aberrations as well. More importantly, analysis of the sequenced Drosophila genome suggests the existence of multiple protein variants from the CASK locus, further complicating the interpretation of experiments using deficiency strains. In this study, we generated small deletions within the CASK gene that eliminate gene products containing the CaMK-like and L27 domains (CASK-$\beta$), but do not affect transcripts encoding the smaller forms (CASK-$\alpha$), which are structurally homologous to vertebrate MPP1. These mutants have normal olfactory habituation, but exhibit a striking array of locomotor problems that includes both initiation and motor maintenance defects. Previous studies had suggested that presynaptic release defects at the neuromuscular junction in the multigene deficiency strain were the likely basis of its locomotor phenotype. The locomotor phenotype of the CASK-$\beta$ mutant, however, cannot be rescued by expression of a CASK-$\beta$ transgene in motor neurons. Expression in a subset of central neurons that does not include the ellipsoid body, a well-known pre-motor neuropil, provides complete rescue. Full-length CASK-$\beta$, while widely expressed in the nervous system, appears to have a unique role within central circuits that control motor output.},

@article{Chen2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The trafficking of mitochondria within neurons is a highly regulated process. In an earlier study, we found that serotonin (5-HT), acting through the 5-HT1A receptor subtype, promotes axonal transport of mitochondria in cultured hippocampal neurons by increasing Akt activity, and consequently decreasing glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3beta) activity. This finding suggests a critical role for neuromodulators in the regulation of mitochondrial trafficking in neurons. In the present study, we investigate the effects of a second important neuromodulator, dopamine, on mitochondrial transport in hippocampal neurons. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we show that dopamine, like 5-HT, regulates mitochondrial motility in cultured hippocampal neurons through the Akt-GSK3beta signaling cascade. But, in contrast to the stimulatory effect of 5-HT, administration of exogenous dopamine or bromocriptine, a dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) agonist, caused an inhibition of mitochondrial movement. Moreover, pretreatment with bromocriptine blocked the stimulatory effect of 5-HT on mitochondrial movement. Conversely, in cells pretreated with 5-HT, no further increases in movement were observed after administration of haloperidol, a D2R antagonist. In contrast to the effect of the D2R agonist, addition of SKF38393, a dopamine 1 receptor (D1R) agonist, promoted mitochondrial transport, indicating that the inhibitory effect of dopamine was actually the net summation of opposing influences of the two receptor subtypes. The most pronounced effect of dopamine signals was on mitochondria that were already moving directionally. Western blot analysis revealed that treatment with either a D2R agonist or a D1R antagonist decreased Akt activity, and conversely, treatment with either a D2R antagonist or a D1R agonist increased Akt activity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our observations strongly suggest a role for both dopamine and 5-HT in regulating mitochondrial movement, and indicate that the integrated effects of these two neuromodulators may be important in determining the distribution of energy sources in neurons.},

abstract = {The synaptic growth of neurons during the development and adult life of an animal is a very dynamic and highly regulated process. During larval development in Drosophila new boutons and branches are added at the glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) until a balance between neuronal activity and morphological structures is reached. Analysis of several Drosophila mutants suggest that bouton number and size might be regulated by separate signaling processes [Budnik, V., 1996. Synapse maturation and structural plasticity at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 6, 858-867.]. Here we show a new role for Hangover as a negative regulator of bouton number at the NMJ. The hangover gene (hang) encodes a nuclear zinc finger protein. It has a function in neuronal plasticity mediating ethanol tolerance, a behavior that develops upon previous experience with ethanol. hangAE10 mutants have more boutons and an extended synaptic span. Moreover, Hang expression in the motoneuron is required for the regulation of bouton number and the overall length of muscle innervation. However, the increase in bouton number does not correlate with a change in synaptic transmission, suggesting a mechanism independent from neuronal activity leads to the surplus of synaptic boutons. In contrast, we find that expression levels of the cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin II (FASII) are reduced in the hang mutant. This finding suggests that the increase in bouton number in hang mutants is caused by a reduction in FASII expression, thus, linking the regulation of nuclear gene expression with the addition of boutons at the NMJ regulated by cell adhesion molecules. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We employ nc82 to identify Bruchpilot protein (BRP) as a previously unknown AZ component. BRP shows homology to human AZ protein ELKS/CAST/ERC, which binds RIM1 in a complex with Bassoon and Munc13-1. The C terminus of BRP displays structural similarities to multifunctional cytoskeletal proteins. During development, transcription of the bruchpilot locus (brp) coincides with neuronal differentiation. Panneural reduction of BRP expression by RNAi constructs permits a first functional characterization of this large AZ protein: larvae show reduced evoked but normal spontaneous transmission at neuromuscular junctions. In adults, we observe loss of T bars at active zones, absence of synaptic components in electroretinogram, locomotor inactivity, and unstable flight (hence "bruchpilot" - crash pilot). We propose that BRP is critical for intact AZ structure and normal-evoked neurotransmitter release at chemical synapses of Drosophila. ©2006 Elsevier Inc.},

Adults carrying either of two mutations in push exhibit sluggishness, uncoordination, a defective escape response, and male sterility. Larvae defective in push exhibit increased release of transmitter at the neuromuscular junction. In particular, the frequency of spontaneous transmitter release and the amount of transmitter release evoked by nerve stimulation are each increased two- to threefold in push mutants at the lowest external [Ca2+] tested (0.15 mM). Furthermore, these mutants are more sensitive than wild type to application of the potassium channel-blocking drug quinidine: following quinidine application, push mutants, but not wild-type, display repetitive firing of the motor axon, leading to repetitive muscle postsynaptic potentials. The push gene thus might affect both neuronal excitability and the transmitter release process. Complementation tests and recombinational mapping suggest that the push mutations are allelic to a previously identified P-element-induced mutation, which also causes behavioral abnormalities and male sterility.},

However, its functions in other complex behaviors have not been well-characterized. Here, we show experimentally in Drosophila that the for gene is required in the operant visual learning paradigm. Visual pattern memory was normal in a natural variant rover (for(R)) but was impaired in another natural variant sitter (for(S)), which has a lower PKG level. Memory defects in for(S) flies could be rescued by either constitutive or adult-limited expression of for in the fan-shaped body. Interestingly, we showed that such rescue also occurred when for was expressed in the ellipsoid body. Additionally, expression of for in the fifth layer of the fan-shaped body restored sufficient memory for the pattern parameter "elevation" but not for "contour orientation," whereas expression of for in the ellipsoid body restored sufficient memory for both parameters. Our study defines a Drosophila model for further understanding the role of cGMP-PKG signaling in associative learning/memory and the neural circuit underlying this for-dependent visual pattern memory.},

Here, we propose a model of individual e-mail communication that is sufficiently rich to capture meaningful variability across individuals, while remaining simple enough to be interpretable. We show that the model, a cascading non-homogeneous Poisson process, can be formulated as a double-chain hidden Markov model, allowing us to use an efficient inference algorithm to estimate the model parameters from observed data. We then apply this model to two e-mail data sets consisting of 404 and 6,164 users, respectively, that were collected from two universities in different countries and years. We find that the resulting best-estimate parameter distributions for both data sets are surprisingly similar, indicating that at least some features of communication dynamics generalize beyond specific contexts. We also find that variability of individual behavior over time is significantly less than variability across the population, suggesting that individuals can be classified into persistent "types". We conclude that communication patterns may prove useful as an additional class of attribute data, complementing demographic and network data, for user classification and outlier detection--a point that we illustrate with an interpretable clustering of users based on their inferred model parameters.},

abstract = {Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity has been implicated in the refinement and modification of neural circuits during development and learning. Previous studies show that activity-induced facilitation and potentiation are disrupted at larval neuromuscular junctions in the memory mutants dunce (dnc) and rutabaga (rut) of Drosophila. The diminished learning-memory capacity and synaptic transmission plasticity have been associated with altered cAMP levels since dnc affects the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase and rut affects adenylate cyclase. In this study, the morphology of larval motor axon terminals was examined by anti-HRP immunohistochemistry. It was found that the numbers of terminal varicosities and branches were increased in dnc mutants, which have elevated cAMP concentrations. Such increase was suppressed in dnc rut double mutants by rut mutations, which reduce cAMP synthesis. More profuse projections of larval motor axons have also been reported in double-mutant combinations of ether \`{a} go-go (eag) and Shaker (Sh) alleles, which display greatly enhanced nerve activity as a result of reduction in different K+ currents. Therefore, we examined combinations of dnc and rut with eag and Sh mutations to explore the possible relation between activity- and cAMP-induced morphological changes. We found that the expanded projections in dnc were further enhanced in double mutants of dnc with either eag or Sh, an effect that could again be suppressed by rut. The results provide evidence for altered plasticity of synaptic morphology in memory mutants dnc and rut and suggest a role of cAMP cascade in mediating activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {The glutamatergic synapses of developing neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) of Drosophila larvae are readily accessible, morphologically simple, and physiologically well-characterized. They therefore have a long and highly successful tradition as a model system for the discovery of genetic and molecular mechanisms of target recognition, synaptogenesis, NMJ development, and synaptic plasticity. However, since the development and the activity-dependent refinement of NMJs are concurrent processes, they cannot easily be separated by the widely applied genetic manipulations that mostly have chronic effects. Recent studies have therefore begun systematically to incorporate larval foraging behavior into the physiological and genetic analysis of NMJ function in order to analyze potential experience-dependent changes of glutamatergic transmission. These studies have revealed that recent crawling experience is a potent modulator of glutamatergic transmission at NMJs, because high crawling activities result after an initial lag-phase in several subsequent phases of experience-dependent synaptic potentiation. Depending on the time window of occurrence, four distinct phases of experience-dependent potentiation have been defined. These phases of potentiation can be followed from their initial induction (phase-I) up to the morphological consolidation (phase-III/IV) of previously established functional changes (phase-II). This therefore establishes, for the first time, a temporal hierarchy of mechanisms involved in the use-dependent modification of glutamatergic synapses.},

abstract = {Male Drosophila melanogaster (Canton-S strain) exhibit aggression in competition for resources, to defend territory, and for access to mates. In the study reported here, we asked: (i) how long flies fight; (ii) whether flies adopt distinct winning and losing strategies as hierarchical relationships are established; (iii) whether flies exhibit experience-dependent changes in fighting strategies in later fights; and (iv) whether flies fight differently in second fights against familiar or unfamiliar opponents. The results showed that flies fought for up to 5 h. As hierarchical relationships were established, behavioral strategies changed: winners progressively lunged more and retreated less, whereas losers progressively lunged less and retreated more. Encounters between flies were frequent during the first 10 min of pairing and then dropped significantly. To ask whether flies remembered previous fights, they were re-paired with familiar or unfamiliar opponents after 30 min of separation. In familiar pairings, there were fewer encounters during the first 10 min of fighting than in unfamiliar pairings, and former losers fought differently against familiar winners than unfamiliar winners. Former losers lost or no decision was reached in all second fights in pairings with familiar or unfamiliar winners or with naive flies. Winner/winner, loser/loser, and naive/naive pairings revealed that losers used low-intensity strategies in later fights and were unlikely to form new hierarchical relationships, compared with winners or socially naive flies. These results strongly support the idea that learning and memory accompany the changes in social status that result from fruit fly fights.},

It was used successfully with Musca domestica (house fly) and Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). The detector works by utilising the detector pad as a variable capacitor which forms part of an RC oscillator. Its capacitance changes as the fly comes in contact with it and this change in capacitance is detected by the circuit. The detector uses cheap and readily available components and can be constructed without expert knowledge in electronics. It can be used to detect and determine the timing of the jump of a fly escaping in response to, say, a visual stimulus. It can also be used for screening of mutants of Drosophila which show altered escape responses and for monitoring locomotion of small animals.},

abstract = {Dopamine is found in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues in the larval stage of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and functions as a signaling molecule in the nervous system. Although dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) were previously thought solely to be interneurons, recent studies suggest that dopamine may also act as a neuromodulator in humoral pathways. We examined both application of dopamine on intact larval CNS-segmental preparations and isolated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Dopamine rapidly decreased the rhythmicity of the CNS motor activity. Application of dopamine on neuromuscular preparations of the segmental muscles 6 and 7 resulted in a dose-responsive decrease in the excitatory junction potentials (EJPs). With the use of focal, macro-patch synaptic current recordings the quantal evoked transmission showed a depression of vesicular release at concentrations of 10 microM. Higher concentrations (1 mM) produced a rapid decrement in evoked vesicular release. Dopamine did not alter the shape of the spontaneous synaptic currents, suggesting that dopamine does not alter the postsynaptic muscle fiber receptiveness to the glutaminergic motor nerve transmission. The effects are presynaptic in causing a reduction in the number of vesicles that are stimulated to be released due to neural activity.},

abstract = {We review work in the major model systems for habituation in Drosophila melanogaster, encompassing several sensory modalities and behavioral contexts: visual (giant fiber escape response, landing response); chemical (proboscis extension reflex, olfactory jump response, locomotory startle response, odor-induced leg response, experience-dependent courtship modification); electric (shock avoidance); and mechanical (leg resistance reflex, cleaning reflex). Each model system shows several of Thompson and Spencer's [Thompson, R. F., \& Spencer, W. A. (1966). Habituation: A model phenomenon for the study of neuronal substrates of behavior. Psychological Review, 73, 16-43] parametric criteria for habituation: spontaneous recovery and dishabituation have been described in almost all of them and dependence of habituation upon stimulus frequency and stimulus intensity in the majority. Stimulus generalization (and conversely, the delineation of stimulus specificity) has given insights into the localization of habituation or the neural architecture underlying sensory processing. The strength of Drosophila for studying habituation is the range of genetic approaches available. Mutations have been used to modify specific neuroanatomical structures, ion channels, elements of synaptic transmission, and second-messenger pathways. rutabaga and dunce, genes of the cAMP signal pathway that have been studied most often in the reviewed experiments, have also been implicated in synaptic plasticity and associative conditioning in Drosophila and other species including mammals. The use of the Gal4/UAS system for targeting gene expression has enabled genetic perturbation of defined sets of neurons. One clear lesson is that a gene may affect habituation differently in different behaviors, depending on the expression, processing, and localization of the gene product in specific circuits. Mutations of specific genes not only provide links between physiology and behavior in the same circuit, but also reveal common mechanisms in different paradigms of behavioral plasticity. The rich repertoire of models for habituation in the fly is an asset for combining a genetic approach with behavioral, anatomical and physiological methods with the promise of a more complete understanding. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Fuentes-Medel2009,
abstract = {Synapse remodeling is an extremely dynamic process, often regulated by neural activity. Here we show during activity-dependent synaptic growth at the Drosophila NMJ many immature synaptic boutons fail to form stable postsynaptic contacts, are selectively shed from the parent arbor, and degenerate or disappear from the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Surprisingly, we also observe the widespread appearance of presynaptically derived "debris" during normal synaptic growth. The shedding of both immature boutons and presynaptic debris is enhanced by high-frequency stimulation of motorneurons, indicating that their formation is modulated by neural activity. Interestingly, we find that glia dynamically invade the NMJ and, working together with muscle cells, phagocytose shed presynaptic material. Suppressing engulfment activity in glia or muscle by disrupting the Draper/Ced-6 pathway results in a dramatic accumulation of presynaptic debris, and synaptic growth in turn is severely compromised. Thus actively growing NMJ arbors appear to constitutively generate an excessive number of immature boutons, eliminate those that are not stabilized through a shedding process, and normal synaptic expansion requires the continuous clearance of this material by both glia and muscle cells.},

In this Letter we obtain exact results for the Barab\'{a}si model with two tasks, calculating the priority and waiting time distribution of active tasks. We demonstrate that the model has a singular behavior in the extremal dynamics limit, when the highest priority task is selected first. We find that independently of the selection protocol, the average waiting time is smaller or equal to the number of active tasks, and discuss the asymptotic behavior of the waiting time distribution. These results have important implications for understanding complex systems with extremal dynamics.},

PKMzeta is a truncated, persistently active isoform of atypical protein kinase C-zeta (aPKCzeta), which lacks the N-terminal pseudosubstrate regulatory domain. Using a Pavlovian olfactory learning task in Drosophila, we found that induction of the mouse aPKMzeta (MaPKMzeta) transgene enhanced memory. The enhancement required persistent kinase activity and was temporally specific, with optimal induction at 30 minutes after training. Induction also enhanced memory after massed training and corrected the memory defect of radish mutants, but did not improve memory produced by spaced training. The 'M' isoform of the Drosophila homolog of MaPKCzeta (DaPKM) was present and active in fly heads. Chelerythrine, an inhibitor of PKMzeta, and the induction of a dominant-negative MaPKMzeta transgene inhibited memory without affecting learning. Finally, induction of DaPKM after training also enhanced memory. These results show that atypical PKM is sufficient to enhance memory in Drosophila and suggest that it is necessary for normal memory maintenance.},

To take advantage of modern methods of genetic analysis for studying this complex behavior, we have developed a quantitative framework for studying aggression in common laboratory strains of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In the present study we analyze 73 experiments in which socially naive male fruit flies interacted in more than 2,000 individual agonistic interactions. This allows us to (i) generate an ethogram of the behaviors that occur during agonistic interactions; (ii) calculate descriptive statistics for these behaviors; and (iii) identify their temporal patterns by using sequence analysis. Thirty-minute paired trials between flies contained an average of 27 individual agonistic interactions, lasting a mean of 11 seconds and featuring a variety of intensity levels. Only few fights progressed to the highest intensity levels (boxing and tussling). A sequential analysis demonstrated the existence of recurrent patterns in behaviors with some similarity to those seen during courtship. Based on the patterns characterized in the present report, a detailed examination of aggressive behavior by using mutant strains and other techniques of genetic analysis becomes possible.},

abstract = {Substantial advances have been made in recent years in the understanding of the genetic basis of behavior in "simpler" organisms, especially the mouse and the fruit fly Drosophila. The authors examine the degree of similarity between the genetic underpinnings of psychiatric illness and genetic influences on behavior in such simpler organisms. Six topics are reviewed: 1) the extent of natural genetic variation, 2) the multigenic nature of natural variation, 3) the impact of individual genes on multiple traits, 4) gene-environment interactions, 5) genetic effects on the environment, and 6) gene-by-sex interactions. The results suggest that the pattern of results emerging in psychiatric genetics is generally consistent with the findings of behavioral genetics in simpler organisms. Across the animal kingdom, individual differences in behavior are nearly always influenced by genetic factors which, in turn, result from a substantial number of individual genes, each with a small effect. Nearly all genes that affect behavior influence multiple phenotypes. The impact of individual genes can be substantially modified by other genes and/or by environmental experiences. Many animals alter their environment, and the nature of that alteration is influenced by genes. For some behaviors, the pathway from genes to behavior differs meaningfully in males and females. With respect to the broad patterns of genetic influences on behavior, Homo sapiens appears to be typical of other animal species.},

@article{Wolf2008,
abstract = {In many animal species, individuals differ consistently in suites of correlated behaviors, comparable with human personalities. Increasing evidence suggests that one of the fundamental factors structuring personality differences is the responsiveness of individuals to environmental stimuli. Whereas some individuals tend to be highly responsive to such stimuli, others are unresponsive and show routine-like behaviors. Much research has focused on the proximate causes of these differences but little is known about their evolutionary origin. Here, we provide an evolutionary explanation. We develop a simple but general evolutionary model that is based on two key ingredients. First, the benefits of responsiveness are frequency-dependent; that is, being responsive is advantageous when rare but disadvantageous when common. This explains why responsive and unresponsive individuals can coexist within a population. Second, positive-feedback mechanisms reduce the costs of responsiveness; that is, responsiveness is less costly for individuals that have been responsive before. This explains why individuals differ consistently in their responsiveness, across contexts and over time. As a result, natural selection gives rise to stable individual differences in responsiveness. Whereas some individuals respond to environmental stimuli in all kinds of contexts, others consistently neglect such stimuli. Interestingly, such differences induce correlations among all kinds of other traits (e.g., boldness and aggressiveness), thus providing an explanation for environment-specific behavioral syndromes.},

We demonstrate that wild-type animals diminish their responses to electric shock stimuli with properties characteristic of short- and long-term habituation. We used spatially restricted abrogation of neurotransmission to identify brain areas involved in this behavioral response. We find that the mushroom bodies and, in particular, the alpha/beta lobes appear to guard against habituating prematurely to repetitive electric shock stimuli. In addition to protection from premature habituation, the mushroom bodies are essential for spontaneous recovery and dishabituation. These results reveal a novel modulatory role of the mushroom bodies on responses to repetitive stimuli in agreement with and complementary to their established roles in olfactory learning and memory.},

The animals choose a preferred location, become immobile for periods of up to 157 min at a particular time in the circadian day, and are relatively unresponsive to sensory stimuli. Rest is affected by both homeostatic and circadian influences: when rest is prevented, the flies increasingly tend to rest despite stimulation and then exhibit a rest rebound. Drugs acting on a mammalian adenosine receptor alter rest as they do sleep, suggesting conserved neural mechanisms. Finally, normal homeostatic regulation depends on the timeless but not the period central clock gene. Understanding the molecular features of Drosophila rest should shed new light on the mechanisms and function of sleep.},

abstract = {The cAMP-responsive transcription factor, CREB, is required for formation of long-term memory (LTM) in Drosophila melanogaster and regulates transcription of a circadian clock gene, period (per). Involvement of CREB both in LTM and circadian rhythm raises the possibility that per also plays a role in LTM. Assaying the experience-dependent courtship inhibition in male flies as a measure for LTM, we show here that per mutants are defective in LTM formation. This defect was rescued by induction of a wild-type per transgene in a per-null mutant, and overexpression of per enhanced LTM formation in the wild-type background. Furthermore, we found that synaptic transmission through per-expressing cells is most likely to be required during retrieval of LTM. In contrast, mutations in other clock genes (timeless, dClock, and cycle) did not affect LTM formation. Thus, independent of the core oscillator of circadian clock, per plays a key role in LTM formation.},

Whereas philosophers have discussed for centuries the apparent lack of a causal component for free will, many biologists still seem to be remarkably at ease with this notion of free will; and furthermore, our judicial system is based on such a belief.

Current understanding of the roles of the Shab IK channel and its mammalian Kv2 counterparts is relatively poor, as compared with that for Shaker IA channels and their Kv1 homologues. Our results revealed the striking effect of Shab mutations during high-frequency synaptic activity, as well as a functional division in synaptic regulation between the Shaker and Shab channels. Shaker channels control the basal level of release, indicated by a response to single nerve stimulation, whereas Shab channels regulate repetitive synaptic activities. These observations highlight the crucial control of nerve terminal excitability by Shaker and Shab channels to confer temporal patterns of synaptic transmission and suggest the potential participation of these channels, along with the transmitter release machinery, in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {Using Drosophila mutants and pharmacological blockers, we provide the first evidence that distinct types of K+ channels differentially influence sub-cellular Ca2+ regulation and growth cone morphology during neuronal development. Fura-2-based imaging revealed in cultured embryonic neurons that the loss of either voltage-gated, inactivating Shaker channels or Ca2+-gated Slowpoke BK channels led to robust spontaneous Ca2+ transients that preferentially occurred within the growth cone. In contrast, loss of voltage-gated, non-inactivating Shab channels did not show such a disparity and sometimes produced soma-specific Ca2+ transients. The fast spontaneous transients in both the soma and growth cone were suppressed by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin, indicating that these Ca2+ fluctuations stemmed from increases in membrane excitability. Similar differences in regional Ca2+ regulation were observed upon membrane depolarization by high K+-containing saline. In particular, Shaker and slowpoke mutations enhanced the size and dynamics of the depolarization-induced Ca2+ increase in the growth cone. In contrast, Shab mutations greatly prolonged the Ca2+ increase in the soma. Differential effects of these excitability mutations on neuronal development were indicated by their distinct alterations in growth cone morphology. Loss of Shaker currents increased the size of lamellipodia and the number of filopodia, structures associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, loss of Slowpoke currents strongly influenced tubulin regulation, enhancing the number of microtubule loop structures per growth cone. Together, our findings support the idea that individual K+ channel subunits differentially regulate spontaneous sub-cellular Ca2+ fluctuations in growing neurons that may influence activity-dependent growth cone formation. ?? 2006 IBRO.},

Although dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) were previously thought solely to be interneurons, recent studies suggest that dopamine may also act as a neuromodulator in humoral pathways. We examined both application of dopamine on intact larval CNS-segmental preparations and isolated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Dopamine rapidly decreased the rhythmicity of the CNS motor activity. Application of dopamine on neuromuscular preparations of the segmental muscles 6 and 7 resulted in a dose-responsive decrease in the excitatory junction potentials (EJPs). With the use of focal, macro-patch synaptic current recordings the quantal evoked transmission showed a depression of vesicular release at concentrations of 10 microM. Higher concentrations (1 mM) produced a rapid decrement in evoked vesicular release. Dopamine did not alter the shape of the spontaneous synaptic currents, suggesting that dopamine does not alter the postsynaptic muscle fiber receptiveness to the glutaminergic motor nerve transmission. The effects are presynaptic in causing a reduction in the number of vesicles that are stimulated to be released due to neural activity.},

abstract = {The Drosophila fruitless (fru) gene product Fru has been postulated to be a neural sex determination factor that directs development of the central nervous system (CNS), thereby producing male-typical courtship behaviour and inducing male-specific muscle. Male-specific Fru protein is expressed in small groups of neurons scattered throughout the CNS of male, but not female, Drosophila. Collectively, these observations suggest that Fru 'masculinizes' certain neurons, thereby establishing neural substrates for male-typical behaviour. However, specific differences between neurons resulting from the presence or absence of Fru are unknown. Previous studies have suggested that Fru might result in sexual differences in the CNS at the functional level, as no overt sexual dimorphism in CNS structure was discernible. Here we identify a subset of fru-expressing interneurons in the brain that show marked sexual dimorphism in their number and projection pattern. We also demonstrate that Fru supports the development of neurons with male-specific dendritic fields, which are programmed to die during female development as a result of the absence of Fru. Thus, Fru expression can produce a male-specific neural circuit, probably used during heterosexual courtship, by preventing cell death in identifiable neurons.},

The mushroom bodies receive chemosensory inputs from the antennal lobes at the level of the calyx. In this study we report that larval density affects calyx volume measured shortly after eclosion from the pupal case. We observe that in the memory mutant amnesiac this form of experience-dependent structural plasticity is missing, whereas it is not affected in the learning mutant rutabaga and in the memory mutant radish. Independent of the plasticity effect, the calyces are on average slightly bigger than wild type in amnesiac and smaller in rutabaga flies.},

abstract = {Two Drosophila genes encoding products related to cGMP-dependent protein kinase have been isolated by cross-hybridization to a Drosophila cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit gene. Both genes encode products with putative cGMP binding and kinase domains on the same polypeptide chain, as found for the prototypical bovine lung cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The deduced product of one gene (DG1; cytological position, 21D) is 14\% larger than the bovine enzyme and differs substantially in sequence at the amino terminus, the region responsible in the bovine enzyme for dimerization. The second gene (DG2; cytological position, 24A) is transcribed into three major RNA species of different size. The largest (DG2; T1) and smallest (DG2;T3) RNAs encode overlapping polypeptides of similar sequence to the whole length of bovine lung cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The translation product of the third major RNA (DG2;T2) lacks sequences similar to those that constitute the dimerization and kinase inhibitory domains of the bovine enzyme. The percentage amino acid identity between DG1 or DG2 and bovine lung cGMP-dependent protein kinase is 55 and 64\%, respectively. A common progenitor of the two cGMP-dependent protein kinase genes, DG1 and DG2, is strongly suggested by the conserved positions of introns in these genes.},

Here, we have targeted expression of synapto-pHluorin, a pH-sensitive protein that reports synaptic vesicle fusion, to olfactory sensory neurons in mouse. Synapto-pHluorin selectively labeled presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons in glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. Odorant stimulation evoked large-amplitude fluorescence increases that were localized to individual glomeruli in vivo, correlated with presynaptic calcium influx, graded with stimulus intensity, and stable over a period of days. Spatial patterns of odorant-activated glomeruli were distributed and did not change systematically with increasing carbon chain length, in contrast to the finely organized chemotopy that has been reported using other imaging methods. Targeted expression of synapto-pHluorin in mouse will permit the analysis of previously inaccessible neuronal populations and chronic imaging from genetically identified neurons in vivo.},

abstract = {Species-area relationships (SARs) are fundamental to the study of key and high-profile issues in conservation biology and are particularly widely used in establishing the broad patterns of biodiversity that underpin approaches to determining priority areas for biological conservation. Classically, the SAR has been argued in general to conform to a power-law relationship, and this form has been widely assumed in most applications in the field of conservation biology. Here, using nonlinear regressions within an information theoretical model selection framework, we included uncertainty regarding both model selection and parameter estimation in SAR modeling and conducted a global-scale analysis of the form of SARs for vascular plants and major vertebrate groups across 792 terrestrial ecoregions representing almost 97\% of Earth's inhabited land. The results revealed a high level of uncertainty in model selection across biomes and taxa, and that the power-law model is clearly the most appropriate in only a minority of cases. Incorporating this uncertainty into a hotspots analysis using multimodel SARs led to the identification of a dramatically different set of global richness hotspots than when the power-law SAR was assumed. Our findings suggest that the results of analyses that assume a power-law model may be at severe odds with real ecological patterns, raising significant concerns for conservation priority-setting schemes and biogeographical studies.},

abstract = {The synaptic growth of neurons during the development and adult life of an animal is a very dynamic and highly regulated process. During larval development in Drosophila new boutons and branches are added at the glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) until a balance between neuronal activity and morphological structures is reached. Analysis of several Drosophila mutants suggest that bouton number and size might be regulated by separate signaling processes [Budnik, V., 1996. Synapse maturation and structural plasticity at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 6, 858-867.]. Here we show a new role for Hangover as a negative regulator of bouton number at the NMJ. The hangover gene (hang) encodes a nuclear zinc finger protein. It has a function in neuronal plasticity mediating ethanol tolerance, a behavior that develops upon previous experience with ethanol. hangAE10 mutants have more boutons and an extended synaptic span. Moreover, Hang expression in the motoneuron is required for the regulation of bouton number and the overall length of muscle innervation. However, the increase in bouton number does not correlate with a change in synaptic transmission, suggesting a mechanism independent from neuronal activity leads to the surplus of synaptic boutons. In contrast, we find that expression levels of the cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin II (FASII) are reduced in the hang mutant. This finding suggests that the increase in bouton number in hang mutants is caused by a reduction in FASII expression, thus, linking the regulation of nuclear gene expression with the addition of boutons at the NMJ regulated by cell adhesion molecules. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Mutations of the Shaker (Sh) locus of Drosophila reduce, eliminate, or otherwise alter a transient potassium current, IA, in muscle. Recent molecular studies indicate that the Sh locus produces several proteins by alternative splicing, but the relationships of the variety of Sh gene products to IA channels in the various excitable membranes still remain to be determined. In Drosophila, many enzymes have been shown to exhibit gene-dosage effects; their amounts vary in direct proportion to the number of structural genes present. We describe a physiological isolation of IA in larval muscle which allowed precise quantification of gene-dosage effects on IA in Sh heterozygotes and aneuploids. We found that doubling the number of Sh genes in aneuploids increased IA to twice that of normal, consistent with the notion that the Sh locus encodes the entire IA channel in larval muscle. We further examined heterozygous combinations of different Sh mutations for evidence of interactions among Sh gene products within the IA channel, which may yield clues to the possible subunit composition of the channel. Combinations among 5 Sh mutations plus their normal counterpart followed a simple gene-dosage effect; in each case the resulting IA was about the average of the homozygous currents, compatible with the notion of additive contributions from 2 independent populations of IA channels. Two additional Sh mutations caused pronounced departures from the simple dosage effect; the amplitude of IA in heterozygotes was significantly smaller than that expected from gene dosage, a strong dominant effect attributable to interactions among protein subunits. These contrasting observations may be accounted for by certain hetero- or homo-multimeric arrangements of Sh products in the IA channel.},

abstract = {Recent work in experimental neurophysiology has identified distinct neuronal populations in the rodent brain stem and hypothalamus that selectively promote wake and sleep. Mutual inhibition between these cell groups has suggested the conceptual model of a sleep-wake switch that controls transitions between wake and sleep while minimizing time spent in intermediate states. By combining wake- and sleep-active populations with populations governing transitions between different stages of sleep, a "sleep-wake network" of neuronal populations may be defined. To better understand the dynamics inherent in this network, we created a model sleep-wake network composed of coupled relaxation oscillation equations. Mathematical analysis of the deterministic model provides insight into the dynamics underlying state transitions and predicts mechanisms for each transition type. With the addition of noise, the simulated sleep-wake behavior generated by the model reproduces many qualitative and quantitative features of mouse sleep-wake behavior. In particular, the existence of simulated brief awakenings is a unique feature of the model. In addition to capturing the experimentally observed qualitative difference between brief and sustained wake bouts, the model suggests distinct network mechanisms for the two types of wakefulness. Because circadian and other factors alter the fine architecture of sleep-wake behavior, this model provides a novel framework to explore dynamical principles that may underlie normal and pathologic sleep-wake physiology.},

abstract = {Natural variation in neuronal excitability and connectivity has not been extensively studied. In Drosophila melanogaster, a naturally maintained genetic polymorphism at a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) gene, foraging (for), is associated with alternative food search strategies among the allelic variants Rover (for(R); higher PKG activity) and sitter (for(s); lower PKG activity). We examined physiological and morphological variations in nervous systems of these allelic variants isolated from natural populations. Whole-cell current clamping revealed distinct excitability patterns, with spontaneous activities and excessive evoked firing in cultured sitter, but not Rover, neurons. Voltage-clamp examination demonstrated reduced voltage-dependent K(+) currents in sitter neurons. Focal recordings from synapses at the larval neuromuscular junction demonstrated spontaneous activity and supernumerary discharges with increased transmitter release after nerve stimulation. Immunolabeling showed more diffuse motor axon terminal projections with increased ectopic nerve entry points in sitter larval muscles. The differences between the two natural alleles was enhanced in laboratory-induced mutant alleles of the for gene. The pervasive effects of the for-PKG on neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and nerve connectivity illustrate the magnitude of neuronal variability in Drosophila that can be attributed to a single gene. These findings establish the consequences in cellular function for natural variation in an isoform of PKG and suggest a role for natural selection in maintaining variation in neuronal properties.},

abstract = {We used a preparation of acutely dissociated neurons to quantify the ionic currents driving the spontaneous firing of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons, isolated from transgenic mice in which the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter drives expression of human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) on the outer surface of the cell membrane. Dissociated neurons identified by fluorescent antibodies to PLAP showed firing properties similar to those of dopaminergic neurons in brain slice, including rhythmic spontaneous firing of broad action potentials and, in some cells, rhythmic oscillatory activity in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). Spontaneous activity in TTX had broader, smaller spikes than normal pacemaking and was stopped by removal of external calcium. Normal pacemaking was also consistently silenced by replacement of external calcium by cobalt and was slowed by more specific calcium channel blockers. Nimodipine produced a slowing of pacemaking frequency. Pacemaking was also slowed by the P/Q-channel blocker omega-Aga-IVA, but the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA had no effect. In voltage-clamp experiments, using records of pacemaking as command voltage, cobalt-sensitive current and TTX-sensitive current were both sizeable at subthreshold voltages between spikes. Cobalt-sensitive current was consistently larger than TTX-sensitive current at interspike voltages from -70 to -50 mV, with TTX-sensitive current larger at voltages positive to -45 mV. These results support previous evidence for a major role of voltage-dependent calcium channels in driving pacemaking of midbrain dopamine neurons and suggest that multiple calcium channel types contribute to this function. The results also show a significant contribution of subthreshold TTX-sensitive sodium current.},

abstract = {In recent years evidence has been accumulating that personalities are not only found in humans but also in a wide range of other animal species. Individuals differ consistently in their behavioural tendencies and the behaviour in one context is correlated with the behaviour in multiple other contexts. From an adaptive perspective, the evolution of animal personalities is still a mystery, because a more flexible structure of behaviour should provide a selective advantage. Accordingly, many researchers view personalities as resulting from constraints imposed by the architecture of behaviour (but see ref. 12). In contrast, we show here that animal personalities can be given an adaptive explanation. Our argument is based on the insight that the trade-off between current and future reproduction often results in polymorphic populations in which some individuals put more emphasis on future fitness returns than others. Life-history theory predicts that such differences in fitness expectations should result in systematic differences in risk-taking behaviour. Individuals with high future expectations (who have much to lose) should be more risk-averse than individuals with low expectations. This applies to all kinds of risky situations, so individuals should consistently differ in their behaviour. By means of an evolutionary model we demonstrate that this basic principle results in the evolution of animal personalities. It simultaneously explains the coexistence of behavioural types, the consistency of behaviour through time and the structure of behavioural correlations across contexts. Moreover, it explains the common finding that explorative behaviour and risk-related traits like boldness and aggressiveness are common characteristics of animal personalities.},

abstract = {DURING SHORT BURSTS OF NEURONAL ACTIVITY, CHANGES IN THE EFFICACY OF NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE ARE GOVERNED PRIMARILY BY TWO COUNTERACTING PROCESSES: (1) Ca(2+)-dependent elevations of vesicle release probability and (2) depletion of synaptic vesicles. The dynamic interplay of both processes contributes to the expression of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Here, we exploited various facets of short-term plasticity at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction to dissect these two processes. This enabled us to rigorously analyze different models of synaptic vesicle pools in terms of their size and mobilization properties. Independent of the specific model, we estimate approximately 300 readily releasable vesicles with an average release probability of approximately 50\% in 1 mM extracellular calcium ( approximately 5\% in 0.4 mM extracellular calcium) under resting conditions. The models also helped interpreting the altered short-term plasticity of the previously reported mutant of the active zone component Bruchpilot (BRP). Finally, our results were independently confirmed through fluctuation analysis. Our data reveal that the altered short-term plasticity observed in BRP mutants cannot be accounted for by delocalized Ca(2+) channels alone and thus suggest an additional role of BRP in short-term plasticity.},

abstract = {Much of our understanding of synaptogenesis comes from studies that deal with the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Although well studied, it is not clear how far the NMJ represents an adequate model for the formation of synapses within the CNS. Here we investigate the role of Fasciclin II (Fas II) in the development of synapses between identified motor neurons and cholinergic interneurons in the CNS of Drosophila. Fas II is a neural cell adhesion molecule homolog that is involved in both target selection and synaptic plasticity at the NMJ in Drosophila. In this study, we show that levels of Fas II are critical determinants of synapse formation and growth in the CNS. The initial establishment of synaptic contacts between these identified neurons is seemingly independent of Fas II. The subsequent proliferation of these synaptic connections that occurs postembryonically is, in contrast, significantly retarded by the absence of Fas II. Although the initial formation of synaptic connectivity between these neurons is seemingly independent of Fas II, we show that their formation is, nevertheless, significantly affected by manipulations that alter the relative balance of Fas II in the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Increasing expression of Fas II in either the presynaptic or postsynaptic neurons, during embryogenesis, is sufficient to disrupt the normal level of synaptic connectivity that occurs between these neurons. This effect of Fas II is isoform specific and, moreover, phenocopies the disruption to synaptic connectivity observed previously after tetanus toxin light chain-dependent blockade of evoked synaptic vesicle release in these neurons.},

abstract = {We describe the identification of a gene called pushover (push), which affects both behavior and synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Adults carrying either of two mutations in push exhibit sluggishness, uncoordination, a defective escape response, and male sterility. Larvae defective in push exhibit increased release of transmitter at the neuromuscular junction. In particular, the frequency of spontaneous transmitter release and the amount of transmitter release evoked by nerve stimulation are each increased two- to threefold in push mutants at the lowest external [Ca2+] tested (0.15 mM). Furthermore, these mutants are more sensitive than wild type to application of the potassium channel-blocking drug quinidine: following quinidine application, push mutants, but not wild-type, display repetitive firing of the motor axon, leading to repetitive muscle postsynaptic potentials. The push gene thus might affect both neuronal excitability and the transmitter release process. Complementation tests and recombinational mapping suggest that the push mutations are allelic to a previously identified P-element-induced mutation, which also causes behavioral abnormalities and male sterility.},

abstract = {Anatomical and functional refinements of the meso-limbic dopamine system of the rat are discussed. Present experiments suggest that dopaminergic neurons localized in the posteromedial ventral tegmental area (VTA) and central linear nucleus raphe selectively project to the ventromedial striatum (medial olfactory tubercle and medial nucleus accumbens shell), whereas the anteromedial VTA has few if any projections to the ventral striatum, and the lateral VTA largely projects to the ventrolateral striatum (accumbens core, lateral shell and lateral tubercle). These findings complement the recent behavioral findings that cocaine and amphetamine are more rewarding when administered into the ventromedial striatum than into the ventrolateral striatum. Drugs such as nicotine and opiates are more rewarding when administered into the posterior VTA or the central linear nucleus than into the anterior VTA. A review of the literature suggests that (1) the midbrain has corresponding zones for the accumbens core and medial shell; (2) the striatal portion of the olfactory tubercle is a ventral extension of the nucleus accumbens shell; and (3) a model of two dopamine projection systems from the ventral midbrain to the ventral striatum is useful for understanding reward function. The medial projection system is important in the regulation of arousal characterized by affect and drive and plays a different role in goal-directed learning than the lateral projection system, as described in the variation-selection hypothesis of striatal functional organization.},

However, using cameleons to image intracellular calcium concentration changes in vivo is still evolving and is by no means a standard technique. Experimental details and "tricks" for dealing with equipment, techniques, and data evaluation are still restricted to a few laboratories.

In search of other discrete-time finite-dimensional filters, this paper derives filters for general linear exponential state-space models, of which the Kalman filter is a special case. One particularly interesting model for which a finite-dimensional filter is found to exist is a doubly stochastic discrete-time Poisson process whose rate evolves as the square of the state of a linear Gaussian dynamical system. Such a model has wide applications in communications systems and queueing theory. Another filter, also with applications in communications systems, is derived for estimating the arrival times of a Poisson process based on negative exponentially delayed observations.

Our unexpected observation that Dorsal Paired Medial (DPM) neurons, which project only to MB neurons, are required during memory storage but not during acquisition or retrieval, led us to revisit the role of MB neurons in memory processing. We show that neurotransmission from the ?????????? subset of MB neurons is required to acquire and stabilize aversive and appetitive odor memory, but is dispensable during memory retrieval. In contrast, neurotransmission from MB ???? neurons is only required for memory retrieval. These data suggest a dynamic requirement for the different subsets of MB neurons in memory and are consistent with the notion that recurrent activity in an MB ?????????? neuron-DPM neuron loop is required to stabilize memories formed in the MB ???? neurons. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Accounting for the abundance of genetic variation in the face of natural selection remains a central problem of evolutionary biology. Genetic polymorphisms are constantly arising through mutation, and although most are promptly eliminated, polymorphisms in functionally important traits are common. One mechanism that can maintain polymorphisms is negative frequency-dependent selection on alternative alleles, whereby the fitness of each decreases as its frequency increases. Examples of frequency-dependent selection are rare, especially when attempting to describe the genetic basis of the phenotype under selection. Here we show frequency-dependent selection in a well-known natural genetic polymorphism affecting fruitfly foraging behaviour. When raised in low nutrient conditions, both of the naturally occurring alleles of the foraging gene (for(s) and for(R)) have their highest fitness when rare-the hallmark of negative frequency-dependent selection. This effect disappears at higher resources levels, demonstrating the role of larval competition. We are able to confirm the involvement of the foraging gene by showing that a sitter-like mutant allele on a rover background has similar frequency-dependent fitness as the natural sitter allele. Our study represents a clear demonstration of frequency-dependent selection, and we are able to attribute this effect to a single, naturally polymorphic gene known to affect behaviour.},

abstract = {From ants to humans, the timing of many animal behaviors comes in bursts of activity separated by long periods of inactivity. Recently, mathematical modeling has shown that simple algorithms of priority-driven behavioral choice can result in bursty behavior. To experimentally test this link between decision-making circuitry and bursty dynamics, we have turned to Drosophila melanogaster. We have found that the statistics of intervals between activity periods in endogenous activity-rest switches of wild-type Drosophila are very well described by the Weibull distribution, a common distribution of bursty dynamics in complex systems. The bursty dynamics of wild-type Drosophila walking activity are shown to be determined by this inter-event distribution alone and not by memory effects, thus resembling human dynamics. Further, using mutant flies that disrupt dopaminergic signaling or the mushroom body, circuitry implicated in decision-making, we show that the degree of behavioral burstiness can be modified. These results are thus consistent with the proposed link between decision-making circuitry and bursty dynamics, and highlight the importance of using simple experimental systems to test general theoretical models of behavior. The findings further suggest that analysis of bursts could prove useful for the study and evaluation of decision-making circuitry.},

In all vertebrate animal models, including humans [5], and even in fruit flies, sensitization is observed after repeated exposure to volatilized crack cocaine [6]. In vertebrates, sensitization is thought to be initiated by processes occurring in brain regions that contain dopamine cell bodies [2,7]. Here, we show that modulated cell signaling in the Drosophila dopamine and serotonin neurons plays an essential role in cocaine sensitization. Targeted expression of either a stimulatory (G??(s)) or inhibitory (G??(i)) G(??) subunit, or tetanus toxin light chain (TNT) in dopamine and serotonin neurons of living flies blocked behavioral sensitization to repeated cocaine exposures. These flies showed alterations in their initial cocaine responsiveness that correlated with compensatory adaptations of postsynaptic receptor sensitivity. Finally, repeated drug stimulation of a nerve cord preparation that is postsynaptic to the brain amine cells failed to induce sensitization, further showing the importance of presynaptic modulation in sensitization.},

abstract = {Drosophila bang-sensitive paralytic mutants suffer from hyperactivity and paralysis following a mechanical shock; after recovery from paralysis, they cannot be paralyzed for a refractory period lasting up to 1 hr. Previously, we have shown that in easily shocked (eas), a typical bang-sensitive mutant, electrical shocks delivered to the brain cause seizure-like activity in the dorsal longitudinal flight motor neurons (DLMmns), and failure of giant fiber (GF) stimulation to evoke DLM potentials via the escape response pathway (Pavlidis et al., 1994). Here, we show that seizure and failure in the GF pathway with a refractory period is common to all six members of the bang-sensitive class. This syndrome was not found in any of eight other excitability mutants, including those affecting voltage-gated sodium or potassium-channel function. We show that failure occurs at the synapse between a peripherally synapsing interneuron (PSI) and the DLMmns, while the DLMmn-DLM neuromuscular junctions remain functional. Additionally, failure occurs in all other GF pathway-activated muscles. Failures occurred without seizures in the tergotrochanteral jump muscle (TTM), as was also found in approximately 10\% of DLM tests, suggesting that seizures and failures may be independent events. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that, in double mutant combination with mlenapts, which suppresses behavioral bang sensitivity, DLM failures, but not seizures, were reduced.},

abstract = {Targeted gene silencing by RNA interference allows the study of gene function in plants and animals. In cell culture and small animal models, genetic screens can be performed--even tissue-specifically in Drosophila--with genome-wide RNAi libraries. However, a major problem with the use of RNAi approaches is the unavoidable false-positive error caused by off-target effects. Until now, this is minimized by computational RNAi design, comparing RNAi to the mutant phenotype if known, and rescue with a presumed ortholog. The ultimate proof of specificity would be to restore expression of the same gene product in vivo. Here, we present a simple and efficient method to rescue the RNAi-mediated knockdown of two independent genes in Drosophila. By exploiting the degenerate genetic code, we generated Drosophila RNAi Escape Strategy Construct (RESC) rescue proteins containing frequent silent mismatches in the complete RNAi target sequence. RESC products were no longer efficiently silenced by RNAi in cell culture and in vivo. As a proof of principle, we rescue the RNAi-induced loss of function phenotype of the eye color gene white and tracheal defects caused by the knockdown of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan. Our data suggest that RESC is widely applicable to rescue and validate ubiquitous or tissue-specific RNAi and to perform protein structure-function analysis.},

While there has been considerable progress in imaging at the extremes of length scales (e.g., whole brain imaging by fMRI and sub-cellular resolution by two-photon microscopy), there is a need for optical techniques to record the individual activities of large populations of neurons in intact circuits. Current techniques such as epifluorescence microscopy have reasonable time resolution but suffer from signal-to-background problems when viewing thick samples, while confocal techniques are limited in time resolution and/or photon efficiency. To address some of these limitations, we have developed a novel form of microscopy for high-speed three-dimensional fluorescence imaging. Using this technique, entire stacks of high signal-to-noise images can be acquired in seconds.

abstract = {Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have been engineered to produce an optical report in response to cellular signals. FP fluorescence can be made directly sensitive to the chemical environment, via specific mutations of or around the chromophore. Alternatively, FPs can be made indirectly sensitive to cellular signals by their fusion to 'detector' proteins that respond to specific cellular signals with structural rearrangements that act on the FP to alter fluorescence. These optical sensors of membrane voltage, neurotransmitter release, and intracellular messengers, including powerful new sensors of Ca2+, cyclic nucleotides and nitric oxide, are likely to provide new insights into the workings of cellular signals and of information processing in neural circuits.},

abstract = {Mushroom bodies (MBs) are the centers for olfactory associative learning and elementary cognitive functions in the arthropod brain. In order to understand the cellular and genetic processes that control the early development of MBs, we have performed high-resolution neuroanatomical studies of the embryonic and post-embryonic development of the Drosophila MBs. In the mid to late embryonic stages, the pioneer MB tracts extend along Fasciclin II (FAS II)-expressing cells to form the primordia for the peduncle and the medial lobe. As development proceeds, the axonal projections of the larval MBs are organized in layers surrounding a characteristic core, which harbors bundles of actin filaments. Mosaic analyses reveal sequential generation of the MB layers, in which newly produced Kenyon cells project into the core to shift to more distal layers as they undergo further differentiation. Whereas the initial extension of the embryonic MB tracts is intact, loss-of-function mutations of fas II causes abnormal formation of the larval lobes. Mosaic studies demonstrate that FAS II is intrinsically required for the formation of the coherent organization of the internal MB fascicles. Furthermore, we show that ectopic expression of FAS II in the developing MBs results in severe lobe defects, in which internal layers also are disrupted. These results uncover unexpected internal complexity of the larval MBs and demonstrate unique aspects of neural generation and axonal sorting processes during the development of the complex brain centers in the fruit fly brain.},

abstract = {The glutamatergic synapses of developing neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) of Drosophila larvae are readily accessible, morphologically simple, and physiologically well-characterized. They therefore have a long and highly successful tradition as a model system for the discovery of genetic and molecular mechanisms of target recognition, synaptogenesis, NMJ development, and synaptic plasticity. However, since the development and the activity-dependent refinement of NMJs are concurrent processes, they cannot easily be separated by the widely applied genetic manipulations that mostly have chronic effects. Recent studies have therefore begun systematically to incorporate larval foraging behavior into the physiological and genetic analysis of NMJ function in order to analyze potential experience-dependent changes of glutamatergic transmission. These studies have revealed that recent crawling experience is a potent modulator of glutamatergic transmission at NMJs, because high crawling activities result after an initial lag-phase in several subsequent phases of experience-dependent synaptic potentiation. Depending on the time window of occurrence, four distinct phases of experience-dependent potentiation have been defined. These phases of potentiation can be followed from their initial induction (phase-I) up to the morphological consolidation (phase-III/IV) of previously established functional changes (phase-II). This therefore establishes, for the first time, a temporal hierarchy of mechanisms involved in the use-dependent modification of glutamatergic synapses.},

Locomotion is a complex trait, with variation attributable to the joint segregation of multiple interacting quantitative trait loci (QTL), with effects that are sensitive to the environment. We assessed variation in a component of locomotor behavior (locomotor reactivity) in a population of 98 recombinant inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster and mapped four QTL affecting locomotor reactivity by linkage to polymorphic roo transposable element insertion sites. We used complementation tests of deficiencies to fine map these QTL to 12 chromosomal regions and complementation tests of mutations to identify 13 positional candidate genes affecting locomotor reactivity, including Dopa decarboxylase (Ddc), which catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of serotonin and dopamine. Linkage disequilibrium mapping in a population of 164 second chromosome substitution lines derived from a single natural population showed that polymorphisms at Ddc were associated with naturally occurring genetic variation in locomotor behavior. These data implicate variation in the synthesis of bioamines as a factor contributing to natural variation in locomotor reactivity.},

abstract = {A hallmark of behavior is that animals respond to environmental change by switching from one behavioral state to another. However, information on the molecular underpinnings of these behavioral shifts and how they are mediated by the environment is lacking. The ant Pheidole pallidula with its morphologically and behaviorally distinct major and minor workers is an ideal system to investigate behavioral shifts. The physically larger majors are predisposed to defend the ant nest, whereas the smaller minors are the foragers. Despite this predisposition, majors are able to shift to foraging according to the needs of the colony. We show that the ant foraging (ppfor) gene, which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), mediates this shift. Majors have higher brain PKG activities than minors, and the spatial distribution of the PPFOR protein differs in these workers. Specifically, majors express the PPFOR protein in 5 cells in the anterior face of the ant brain, whereas minors do not. Environmental manipulations show that PKG is lower in the presence of a foraging stimulus and higher when defense is required. Finally, pharmacological activation of PKG increases defense and reduces foraging behavior. Thus, PKG signaling plays a critical role in P. pallidula behavioral shifts.},

It is well known that many physical processes in nature and society display long-range correlations. Hence, in the last few years, considerable research effort has been directed towards studying the distribution of return intervals for long-range correlated time series. Based on numerical simulations, it was shown that the return interval distributions are of stretched exponential type. In this paper, we obtain an analytical expression for the distribution of return intervals in long-range correlated time series which holds good when the average return intervals are large. We show that the distribution is actually a product of power law and a stretched exponential form. We also discuss the regimes of validity and perform detailed studies on how the return interval distribution depends on the threshold used to define extreme events.},

The scaling exponent is generally believed to be stable and the significance of the exponent itself with respect to the scale-free behavior remains elusive. We propose a model whereby the scaling exponent of the scale-free behavior of an animal depends on the memory of the individual. The proposed model is based on the premise that animal behaviors are associated with internal states of the animal. The changes in the scaling exponent are derived by considering losing memory as increasing uncertainty, which is expressed in terms of information entropy of the internal states. Predicted model behaviors agree with experimental results of foraging behavior in wild-type and learning/memory Drosophila mutants. The concept of changes in the scaling exponent due to the amount of memory provides a novel insight into the emergence of a scale-free behavior and the meaning of the scaling exponent. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Many free-ranging predators have to make foraging decisions with little, if any, knowledge of present resource distribution and availability. The optimal search strategy they should use to maximize encounter rates with prey in heterogeneous natural environments remains a largely unresolved issue in ecology. L\'{e}vy walks are specialized random walks giving rise to fractal movement trajectories that may represent an optimal solution for searching complex landscapes. However, the adaptive significance of this putative strategy in response to natural prey distributions remains untested. Here we analyse over a million movement displacements recorded from animal-attached electronic tags to show that diverse marine predators-sharks, bony fishes, sea turtles and penguins-exhibit L\'{e}vy-walk-like behaviour close to a theoretical optimum. Prey density distributions also display L\'{e}vy-like fractal patterns, suggesting response movements by predators to prey distributions. Simulations show that predators have higher encounter rates when adopting L\'{e}vy-type foraging in natural-like prey fields compared with purely random landscapes. This is consistent with the hypothesis that observed search patterns are adapted to observed statistical patterns of the landscape. This may explain why L\'{e}vy-like behaviour seems to be widespread among diverse organisms, from microbes to humans, as a 'rule' that evolved in response to patchy resource distributions.},

abstract = {Knowing which genes contribute to natural variation in learning and memory would help us understand how differences in these cognitive traits evolve among populations and species. We show that a natural polymorphism at the foraging (for) locus, which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), affects associative olfactory learning in Drosophila melanogaster. In an assay that tests the ability to associate an odor with mechanical shock, flies homozygous for one natural allelic variant of this gene (forR) showed better short-term but poorer long-term memory than flies homozygous for another natural allele (fors). The fors allele is characterized by reduced PKG activity. We showed that forR-like levels of both short-term learning and long-term memory can be induced in fors flies by selectively increasing the level of PKG in the mushroom bodies, which are centers of olfactory learning in the fly brain. Thus, the natural polymorphism at for may mediate an evolutionary tradeoff between short- and long-term memory. The respective strengths of learning performance of the two genotypes seem coadapted with their effects on foraging behavior: forR flies move more between food patches and so could particularly benefit from fast learning, whereas fors flies are more sedentary, which should favor good long-term memory.},

First, humans and other animals routinely alter their behavior in response to changes in their physical and social environment. As a result, the outcomes of decisions that depend on the behavior of multiple decision makers are difficult to predict and require highly adaptive decision-making strategies. Second, decision makers may have preferences regarding consequences to other individuals and therefore choose their actions to improve or reduce the well-being of others. Many neurobiological studies have exploited game theory to probe the neural basis of decision making and suggested that these features of social decision making might be reflected in the functions of brain areas involved in reward evaluation and reinforcement learning. Molecular genetic studies have also begun to identify genetic mechanisms for personal traits related to reinforcement learning and complex social decision making, further illuminating the biological basis of social behavior.},

Two-microelectrode voltage-clamp experiments showed that DTX reduced the transient K+ current, IA, in muscle membrane. This effect was suppressed by raising the Mg2+ concentration or by lowering the temperature. The interaction of DTX with Mg2+ was further analyzed at a low cation concentration, at which DTX reduced both IA and the delayed rectifier IK. These results were correlated with the action of DTX on the neuromuscular junction. Its facilitatory effect on excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) was relatively mild but the effect was drastically enhanced when combined with certain mutations and K+ channel blocking drugs, leading to repetitive or prolonged giant EJPs. Only the mutations or drugs that reduced IK or the Ca2(+)-dependent K+ current, ICF, could yield these synergistic effects with DTX. In contrast, the abnormal EJPs caused by the mutation or drug that blocked IA were not further enhanced by DTX, indicating that DTX also affects IA at the neuromuscular junction. Thus, the A-type K+ channels in muscle and nerve terminals appeared very similar in their sensitivity to the specific toxin, drugs and mutations examined here.},

Mutations in the octopamine biosynthesis pathway produced a phenotype of increased sleep, which was restored to wild-type levels by pharmacological treatment with octopamine. Moreover, electrical silencing of octopamine-producing cells decreased wakefulness, whereas excitation of these neurons promoted wakefulness. Because protein kinase A (PKA) is a putative target of octopamine signaling and is also implicated in Drosophila sleep, we investigated its role in the effects of octopamine on sleep. We found that decreased PKA activity in neurons rendered flies insensitive to the wake-promoting effects of octopamine. However, this effect of PKA was not exerted in the mushroom bodies, a site previously associated with PKA action on sleep. These studies identify a novel pathway that regulates sleep in Drosophila.},

Each model system shows several of Thompson and Spencer's [Thompson, R. F., \& Spencer, W. A. (1966). Habituation: A model phenomenon for the study of neuronal substrates of behavior. Psychological Review, 73, 16-43] parametric criteria for habituation: spontaneous recovery and dishabituation have been described in almost all of them and dependence of habituation upon stimulus frequency and stimulus intensity in the majority. Stimulus generalization (and conversely, the delineation of stimulus specificity) has given insights into the localization of habituation or the neural architecture underlying sensory processing. The strength of Drosophila for studying habituation is the range of genetic approaches available. Mutations have been used to modify specific neuroanatomical structures, ion channels, elements of synaptic transmission, and second-messenger pathways. rutabaga and dunce, genes of the cAMP signal pathway that have been studied most often in the reviewed experiments, have also been implicated in synaptic plasticity and associative conditioning in Drosophila and other species including mammals. The use of the Gal4/UAS system for targeting gene expression has enabled genetic perturbation of defined sets of neurons. One clear lesson is that a gene may affect habituation differently in different behaviors, depending on the expression, processing, and localization of the gene product in specific circuits. Mutations of specific genes not only provide links between physiology and behavior in the same circuit, but also reveal common mechanisms in different paradigms of behavioral plasticity. The rich repertoire of models for habituation in the fly is an asset for combining a genetic approach with behavioral, anatomical and physiological methods with the promise of a more complete understanding. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels comprise a small subfamily of proteins within the superfamily of pore-loop cation channels. In mammals, the HCN channel family comprises four members (HCN1-4) that are expressed in heart and nervous system. The current produced by HCN channels has been known as I(h) (or I(f) or I(q)). I(h) has also been designated as pacemaker current, because it plays a key role in controlling rhythmic activity of cardiac pacemaker cells and spontaneously firing neurons. Extensive studies over the last decade have provided convincing evidence that I(h) is also involved in a number of basic physiological processes that are not directly associated with rhythmicity. Examples for these non-pacemaking functions of I(h) are the determination of the resting membrane potential, dendritic integration, synaptic transmission, and learning. In this review we summarize recent insights into the structure, function, and cellular regulation of HCN channels. We also discuss in detail the different aspects of HCN channel physiology in the heart and nervous system. To this end, evidence on the role of individual HCN channel types arising from the analysis of HCN knockout mouse models is discussed. Finally, we provide an overview of the impact of HCN channels on the pathogenesis of several diseases and discuss recent attempts to establish HCN channels as drug targets.},

abstract = {Drosophila exhibits a circadian rest-activity cycle, but it is not known whether fly rest constitutes sleep or is mere inactivity. It is shown here that, like mammalian sleep, rest in Drosophila is characterized by an increased arousal threshold and is homeostatically regulated independently of the circadian clock. As in mammals, rest is abundant in young flies, is reduced in older flies, and is modulated by stimulants and hypnotics. Several molecular markers modulated by sleep and waking in mammals are modulated by rest and activity in Drosophila, including cytochrome oxidase C, the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein BiP, and enzymes implicated in the catabolism of monoamines. Flies lacking one such enzyme, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, show increased rest after rest deprivation. These results implicate the catabolism of monoamines in the regulation of sleep and waking in the fly and suggest that Drosophila may serve as a model system for the genetic dissection of sleep.},

abstract = {The neuromuscular system of Drosophila melanogaster has been studied for many years for its relative simplicity and because of the genetic and molecular versatilities. Three main types of striated muscles are present in this dipteran: fibrillar muscles, tubular muscles and supercontractile muscles. The visceral muscles in adult flies and the body wall segmental muscles in embryos and larvae belong to the group of supercontractile muscles. Larval body wall muscles have been the object of detailed studies as a model for neuromuscular junction function but have received much less attention with respect to their mechanical properties and to the control of contraction. In this review we wish to assess available information on the physiology of the Drosophila larval muscular system. Our aim is to establish whether this system has the requisites to be considered a good model in which to perform a functional characterization of Drosophila genes, with a known muscular expression, as well as Drosophila homologs of human genes, the dysfunction of which, is known to be associated with human hereditary muscle pathologies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Rohlfs2005,
abstract = {Background: Competition with filamentous fungi has been demonstrated to be an important cause of mortality for the vast group of insects that depend on ephemeral resources (e.g. fruit, dung, carrion). Recent data suggest that the well-known aggregation of Drosophila larvae across decaying fruit yields a competitive advantage over mould, by which the larvae achieve a higher survival probability in larger groups compared with smaller ones. Feeding and locomotor behaviour of larger larval groups is assumed to cause disruption of fungal hyphae, leading to suppression of fungal growth, which in turn improves the chances of larval survival to the adult stage. Given the relationship between larval density, mould suppression and larval survival, the present study has tested whether fungal-infected food patches elicit communal foraging behaviour on mould-infected sites by which larvae might hamper mould growth more efficiently. Results: Based on laboratory experiments in which Drosophila larvae were offered the choice between fungal-infected and uninfected food patches, larvae significantly aggregated on patches containing young fungal colonies. Grouping behaviour was also visible when larvae were offered only fungal-infected or only uninfected patches; however, larval aggregation was less strong under these conditions than in a heterogeneous environment (infected and uninfected patches). Conclusion: Because filamentous fungi can be deadly competitors for insect larvae on ephemeral resources, social attraction of Drosophila larvae to fungal-infected sites leading to suppression of mould growth may reflect an adaptive behavioural response that increases insect larval fitness and can thus be discussed as an anti-competitor behaviour. These observations support the hypothesis that adverse environmental conditions operate in favour of social behaviour. In a search for the underlying mechanisms of communal behaviour in Drosophila, this study highlights the necessity of investigating the role of inter-kingdom competition as a potential driving force in the evolution of spatial behaviour in insects.},

abstract = {Attempts to relate brain size to behaviour and cognition have rarely integrated information from insects with that from vertebrates. Many insects, however, demonstrate that highly differentiated motor repertoires, extensive social structures and cognition are possible with very small brains, emphasising that we need to understand the neural circuits, not just the size of brain regions, which underlie these feats. Neural network analyses show that cognitive features found in insects, such as numerosity, attention and categorisation-like processes, may require only very limited neuron numbers. Thus, brain size may have less of a relationship with behavioural repertoire and cognitive capacity than generally assumed, prompting the question of what large brains are for. Larger brains are, at least partly, a consequence of larger neurons that are necessary in large animals due to basic biophysical constraints. They also contain greater replication of neuronal circuits, adding precision to sensory processes, detail to perception, more parallel processing and enlarged storage capacity. Yet, these advantages are unlikely to produce the qualitative shifts in behaviour that are often assumed to accompany increased brain size. Instead, modularity and interconnectivity may be more important. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {During nervous system development, synapses undergo morphological change as a function of electrical activity. In Drosophila, enhanced activity results in the expansion of larval neuromuscular junctions. We have examined whether these structural changes involve the pre- or postsynaptic partner by selectively enhancing electrical excitability with a Shaker dominant-negative (SDN) potassium channel subunit. We find that the SDN enhances neurotransmitter release when expressed in motoneurons, postsynaptic potential broadening when expressed in muscles and neurons, and selectively suppresses fast-inactivating, Shaker-mediated IA currents in muscles. SDN expression also phenocopies the canonical behavioral phenotypes of the Sh mutation. At the neuromuscular junction, we find that activity-dependent changes in arbor size occur only when SDN is expressed presynaptically. This finding indicates that elevated postsynaptic membrane excitability is by itself insufficient to enhance presynaptic arbor growth. Such changes must minimally involve increased neuronal excitability.},

@article{VanSwinderen2010,
abstract = {The primary function of a brain is to produce adaptive behavioral choices by selecting the right action at the right time. In humans, attention determines action selection as well as memory formation, whereas memories also guide which external stimuli should be attended to (Chun and Turk-Browne, 2007). The complex codependence of attention, memory, and action selection makes approaching the neurobiological basis of these interactions difficult in higher animals. Therefore, a successful reductionist approach is to turn to simpler systems for unraveling such complex biological problems. In a constantly changing environment, even simple animals have evolved attention-like processes to effectively filter incoming sensory stimuli. These processes can be studied in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, by a variety of behavioral and electrophysiological techniques. Recent work has shown that mutations affecting olfactory memory formation in Drosophila also produce distinct defects in visual attention-like behavior (van Swinderen, 2007; van Swinderen et al., 2009). In this study, we extend those results to describe visual attention-like defects in the Drosophila memory consolidation mutant radish(1). In both behavioral and brain-recording assays, radish mutant flies consistently displayed responses characteristic of a reduced attention span, with more frequent perceptual alternations and more random behavior compared with wild-type flies. Some attention-like defects were successfully rescued by administering a drug commonly used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in humans, methylphenidate. Our results suggest that a balance between persistence and flexibility is crucial for adaptive action selection in flies and that this balance requires radish gene function.},

abstract = {Mitochondria accumulate within nerve terminals and support synaptic function, most notably through ATP production. They can also sequester Ca(2+) during nerve stimulation, but it is unknown whether this limits presynaptic Ca(2+) levels at physiological nerve firing rates. Similarly, it is unclear whether mitochondrial Ca(2+) sequestration differs between functionally different nerve terminals. We addressed these questions using a combination of synthetic and genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicators to examine cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) levels in presynaptic terminals of tonic (MN13-Ib) and phasic (MNSNb/d-Is) motor neurons in Drosophila, which, as we determined, fire during fictive locomotion at approximately 42 Hz and approximately 8 Hz, respectively. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) sequestration starts in both terminals at approximately 250 nM, exhibits a similar Ca(2+)-uptake affinity (approximately 410 nM), and does not require Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Nonetheless, mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in type Is terminals is more responsive to low-frequency nerve stimulation and this is due to higher cytosolic Ca(2+) levels. Since type Ib terminals have a higher mitochondrial density than Is terminals, it seemed possible that greater mitochondrial Ca(2+) sequestration may be responsible for the lower cytosolic Ca(2+) levels in Ib terminals. However, genetic and pharmacological manipulations of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake did not significantly alter nerve-stimulated elevations in cytosolic Ca(2+) levels in either terminal type within physiologically relevant rates of stimulation. Our findings indicate that presynaptic mitochondria have a similar affinity for Ca(2+) in functionally different nerve terminals, but do not limit cytosolic Ca(2+) levels within the range of motor neuron firing rates in situ.},

abstract = {Golgi impregnations reveal a variety of dendritic morphologies amongst Kenyon cells in the mushroom bodies of Drosophila melanogaster. Different morphological types of Kenyon cells contribute axon-like processes to five divisions of the medial and vertical lobes. Four of these divisions have characteristic affinities to antibodies raised against aspartate, glutamate, and taurine. A newly described posterior subdivision of the medial lobe, here named the betac lobe with its vertical branch alphac, comprises glutamatergic Kenyon cells that are probably homologous to glutamatergic Kenyon cells in the cockroach and honey bee, and are the last neurons to differentiate. The first neurons to differentiate, which supply the gamma lobe, are equipped with clawed dendritic specializations and are the structural homologues of clawed class II Kenyon cells supplying the gamma lobes in cockroaches and honey bees. Three intermediate divisions lie between the betac lobe and gamma lobe. These are, from the back towards the front, the beta lobe, the beta' lobe, and a narrow division between beta' and gamma called the beta" lobe. The fused calyx of the Drosophila mushroom body is comparable to the double calyces of Hymenoptera, here exemplified by a basal taxon, Diprion pini. Further similarities between the hymenopteran calyces and those of Drosophila are suggested by the segregation of different types of Kenyon cell dendrites within the calyx neuropil. The organization of afferents from the antennal lobes also defines regions in the Drosophila calyx that may be homologous to the lip and basal ring regions of the honey bee calyces. As in honey bees, GABAergic processes densely invade Drosophila's calyces, which also contain a sparse but uniform distribution of octopaminergic elements. Microsc. Res. Tech. 62:151-169, 2003.},

Whole-cell recording from granule cells revealed that repetitive stimulation causes a calcium- and Ih-dependent long-lasting depolarization mediated by protein kinase A. Depolarization at the terminals would be expected to enhance transmitter release, whereas somatic depolarization would enhance the responsiveness of granule cells to afferent input.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In vertebrates, Ran-Binding Protein in the Microtubule Organizing Center (RanBPM) appears to function as a scaffolding protein in a variety of signal transduction pathways. In Drosophila, RanBPM is implicated in the regulation of germ line stem cell (GSC) niche organization in the ovary. Here, we addressed the role of RanBPM in nervous system function in the context of Drosophila larval behavior. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report that in Drosophila, RanBPM is required for larval feeding, light-induced changes in locomotion, and viability. RanBPM is highly expressed in the Kenyon cells of the larval mushroom body (MB), a structure well studied for its role in associative learning in Drosophila and other insects. RanBPM mutants do not display major disruption in nervous system morphology besides reduced proliferation. Expression of the RanBPM gene in the Kenyon cells is sufficient to rescue all behavioral phenotypes. Through genetic epistasis experiments, we demonstrate that RanBPM participates with the Drosophila orthologue of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) in the development of neuromuscular junction (NMJ). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that the RanBPM gene functions in the MB neurons for larval behavior. Our results suggest a role for this gene in an FMRP-dependent process. Taken together our findings point to a novel role for the MB in larval behavior.},

abstract = {A worker honeybee performs tasks within the hive for approximately the first 3 weeks of adult life. After this time, it becomes a forager, flying repeatedly to collect food outside of the hive for the remainder of its 5-6 week life. Previous studies have shown that foragers have an increased volume of neuropil associated with the mushroom bodies, a brain region involved in learning, memory, and sensory integration. We report here that growth of the mushroom body neuropil in adult bees occurs throughout adult life and continues after bees begin to forage. Studies using Golgi impregnation asked whether the growth of the collar region of the mushroom body neuropil was a result of growth of the dendritic processes of the mushroom body intrinsic neurons, the Kenyon cells. Branching and length of dendrites in the collar region of the calyces were strongly correlated with worker age, but when age-matched bees were directly compared, those with foraging experience had longer, more branched dendrites than bees that had foraged less or not at all. The density of Kenyon cell dendritic spines remained constant regardless of age or behavioral state. Older and more experienced foragers therefore have a greater total number of dendritic spines in the mushroom body neuropil. Our findings indicate that, under natural conditions, the cytoarchitectural complexity of neurons in the mushroom bodies of adult honeybees increases as a function of increasing age, but that foraging experience promotes additional dendritic branching and growth.},

abstract = {In vertebrates, sialylated glycans participate in a wide range of biological processes and affect the development and function of the nervous system. While the complexity of glycosylation and the functional redundancy among sialyltransferases provide obstacles for revealing biological roles of sialylation in mammals, Drosophila possesses a sole vertebrate-type sialyltransferase, Drosophila sialyltransferase (DSiaT), with significant homology to its mammalian counterparts, suggesting that Drosophila could be a suitable model to investigate the function of sialylation. To explore this possibility and investigate the role of sialylation in Drosophila, we inactivated DSiaT in vivo by gene targeting and analyzed phenotypes of DSiaT mutants using a combination of behavioral, immunolabeling, electrophysiological, and pharmacological approaches. Our experiments demonstrated that DSiaT expression is restricted to a subset of CNS neurons throughout development. We found that DSiaT mutations result in significantly decreased life span, locomotor abnormalities, temperature-sensitive paralysis, and defects of neuromuscular junctions. Our results indicate that DSiaT regulates neuronal excitability and affects the function of a voltage-gated sodium channel. Finally, we showed that sialyltransferase activity is required for DSiaT function in vivo, which suggests that DSiaT mutant phenotypes result from a defect in sialylation of N-glycans. This work provided the first evidence that sialylation has an important biological function in protostomes, while also revealing a novel, nervous system-specific function of alpha2,6-sialylation. Thus, our data shed light on one of the most ancient functions of sialic acids in metazoan organisms and suggest a possibility that this function is evolutionarily conserved between flies and mammals.},

abstract = {We have explored the organization of the axonal lobes in Drosophila mushroom bodies by using a panel of immunohistochemical markers. These markers consist of antibodies to eight proteins expressed preferentially in the mushroom bodies: DAMB, DCO, DRK, FASII, LEO, OAMB, PKA RII, and RUT. Previous to this work, four axonal lobes, two projecting dorsally ($\alpha$ and $\alpha$′) and two medially ($\beta$ and $\gamma$), had been described in Drosophila mushroom bodies. However, our analysis of immunohistochemically stained frontal and sagittal sections of the brain revealed three medially projecting lobes. The newly distinguished lobe, which we term $\beta$′, lies along the dorsal surface of $\beta$, just posterior to $\gamma$. In addition to resolving a fifth lobe, our studies revealed that there are specific lobe sets defined by equivalent marker expression levels. These sets are (1) the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ lobes, (2) the $\alpha$′ and $\beta$′ lobes, and (3) the $\gamma$ lobe and heel (a lateral projection formed by a hairpin turn of some of the peduncle fibers). All of the markers we have examined are consistent with these three sets. Previous Golgi studies demonstrate that each mushroom body cell projects one axon that branches into a dorsal lobe and a medial lobe, or one unbranched axon that projects medially. Taken together with the lobe sets listed above, we propose that there are three major projection configurations of mushroom body cell axons: (1) one branch in the $\alpha$ and one in the $\beta$ lobe, (2) one branch in the $\alpha$′ and one in the $\beta$′ lobe, and (3) one unbranched axon projecting to the heel and the $\gamma$ lobe. The fact that these neuron types exhibit differential expression levels of a number of mushroom body genes suggests that they may have corresponding functional differences. These functions may be conserved in the larvae, as several of these genes were expressed in larval and embryonic mushroom bodies as well. The basic mushroom body structure, including the denritic calyx, peduncle, and lobes, was already visible by the late stages of embryogenesis. With new insights into mushroom body organization, and the characterization of markers for developing mushroom bodies, we are beginning to understand how these structures form and function.},

abstract = {The adenylate cyclase/cAMP signaling pathway and adult mushroom bodies (MBs) have been shown to play an important role in sleep regulation in Drosophila. The amnesiac (amn) gene, encodes a neuropeptide that is homologous with vertebrate pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP), is expressed in dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons and is required for the middle-term memory (MTM) in flies. However, the role of amn on regulation of sleep is as yet unknown. Here we provide evidence that amn plays a major role on sleep maintenance and onset in Drosophila. Flies with the amnesiac allele, loss-of-function amnX8 mutation, showed a fragmented sleep pattern and short sleep latency. Moreover, homeostatic regulation was disrupted in amnX8 mutants after sleep deprivation. Sleep maintenance was also influenced by disruption of neurotransmission in DPM neurons with increased sleep bout number and decreased sleep bout length. Furthermore, age-related sleep fragmentation and initiation were inhibited in amnX8 mutant flies. These data suggest that amn is required in initiation and maintenance of sleep. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In vivo stimulation of a relatively "silent" phasic crayfish motoneuron changes the ultrastructure of its synaptic terminals to a more tonic phenotype. The closer muscle of the crayfish claw is supplied by only 2 excitatory motoneurons, one of which is phasic and the other tonic. The ultrastructures of conditioned phasic, unconditioned phasic, and tonic motor terminals were compared. The terminals of the tonic motor axon were larger in cross-sectional area, had larger mitochondria, greater synaptic contact area, and were more varicose than unconditioned phasic terminals. Following long-term tonic stimulation of the phasic axon, its terminals became more varicose, mitochondrial cross-sectional area more than doubled, and synapses and mitochondria came into closer proximity, although mean terminal cross-sectional area did not change. Thus, the conditioned phasic terminals became more similar to those of the tonic motor axon. These changes in ultrastructure correlate with, and may be causally linked to, previously reported changes in neuromuscular synaptic physiology produced by in vivo tonic stimulation of this motoneuron. We conclude that the ongoing level of impulse activity can affect the ultrastructural differentiation of synaptic terminals and synapses of the phasic motoneuron.},

Genetic approaches have proven especially useful for the analysis of the biological functions of cGKs. Recently, some of the in vivo targets and mechanisms leading to changes in neuronal adaptation, smooth muscle relaxation and growth, intestinal water secretion, bone growth, renin secretion, and other important functions have been identified.

The animals choose a preferred location, become immobile for periods of up to 157 min at a particular time in the circadian day, and are relatively unresponsive to sensory stimuli. Rest is affected by both homeostatic and circadian influences: when rest is prevented, the flies increasingly tend to rest despite stimulation and then exhibit a rest rebound. Drugs acting on a mammalian adenosine receptor alter rest as they do sleep, suggesting conserved neural mechanisms. Finally, normal homeostatic regulation depends on the timeless but not the period central clock gene. Understanding the molecular features of Drosophila rest should shed new light on the mechanisms and function of sleep.},

abstract = {I(f), a diastolic depolarizing current activated by hyperpolarization, is a key player in cardiac pacing. Despite the fact that I(f) has been known for over 20 years, the encoding genes, namely HCN1 to 4, have only recently been identified. Functional data imply that different HCN isoforms may coassemble to form heteromeric channel complexes, but little direct evidence is available. Subunit stoichiometry is also unknown. Although the pore region of HCN channels contains the glycine-tyrosine-glycine (GYG) signature motif found in K+-selective channels, they permeate both Na+ and K+. In the present study, we probed the functional importance of the GYG selectivity motif in pacemaker channels by replacing this triplet in HCN1 with alanines (GYG(349-351)AAA or HCN1-AAA). HCN1-AAA did not yield functional currents; coexpression of HCN1-AAA with wild-type (WT) HCN1 suppressed normal channel activity in a dominant-negative manner (55.2+/-3.2\%, 68.3+/-4.3\%, 78.7+/-1.6\%, 91.7+/-0.8\%, and 97.9+/-0.2\% current reduction at -140 mV for WT:AAA cRNA ratios of 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2, respectively) without affecting gating (steady-state activation, activation and deactivation kinetics) or permeation (reversal potential) properties. HCN1-AAA coexpression, however, did not alter the expressed current amplitudes of Kv1.4 and Kv2.1 channels, indicating that its suppressive effect was channel-specific. Statistical analysis reveals that a single HCN channel is composed of 4 monomeric subunits. Interestingly, HCN1-AAA also inhibited HCN2 in a dominant-negative manner with the same efficacy. We conclude that the GYG motif is a critical determinant of ion permeation for HCN channels, and that HCN1 and HCN2 readily coassemble to form heterotetrameric complexes.},

abstract = {Sleep need is affected by developmental stage and neuronal plasticity, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The fragile X mental retardation gene Fmr1, whose loss-of-function mutation causes the most common form of inherited mental retardation in humans, is involved in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity, and its expression depends on both developmental stage and waking experience. Fmr1 is highly conserved across species and Drosophila mutants carrying dFmr1 loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations are well characterized: amorphs have overgrown dendritic trees with larger synaptic boutons, developmental defects in pruning, and enhanced neurotransmission, while hypermorphs show opposite defects, including dendritic and axonal underbranching and loss of synapse differentiation. We find here that dFmr1 amorphs are long sleepers and hypermorphs are short sleepers, while both show increased locomotor activity and shortened lifespan. Both amorphs and hypermorphs also show abnormal sleep homeostasis, with impaired waking performance and no sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. An impairment in the circadian regulation of sleep cannot account for the altered sleep phenotype of dFmr1 mutants, nor can an abnormal activation of glutamatergic metabotropic receptors. Moreover, overexpression of dFmr1 throughout the mushroom bodies is sufficient to reduce sleep. Finally, dFmr1 protein levels are modulated by both developmental stage and behavioral state, with increased expression immediately after eclosure and after prolonged wakefulness. Thus, dFmr1 expression dose-dependently affects both sleep and synapses, suggesting that changes in sleep time in dFmr1 mutants may derive from changes in synaptic physiology.},

We have targeted a genetically encoded optical reporter of synaptic transmission to each of these classes of neurons and visualized population responses to natural odors. The activation of an odor-specific ensemble of olfactory receptor neurons leads to the activation of a symmetric ensemble of projection neurons across the glomerular synaptic relay. Virtually all excited glomeruli receive inhibitory input from local interneurons. The extent, odor specificity, and partly interglomerular origin of this input suggest that inhibitory circuits assemble combinatorially during odor presentations. These circuits may serve as dynamic templates that extract higher order features from afferent activity patterns.},

abstract = {From ants to humans, the timing of many animal behaviors comes in bursts of activity separated by long periods of inactivity. Recently, mathematical modeling has shown that simple algorithms of priority-driven behavioral choice can result in bursty behavior. To experimentally test this link between decision-making circuitry and bursty dynamics, we have turned to Drosophila melanogaster. We have found that the statistics of intervals between activity periods in endogenous activity-rest switches of wild-type Drosophila are very well described by the Weibull distribution, a common distribution of bursty dynamics in complex systems. The bursty dynamics of wild-type Drosophila walking activity are shown to be determined by this inter-event distribution alone and not by memory effects, thus resembling human dynamics. Further, using mutant flies that disrupt dopaminergic signaling or the mushroom body, circuitry implicated in decision-making, we show that the degree of behavioral burstiness can be modified. These results are thus consistent with the proposed link between decision-making circuitry and bursty dynamics, and highlight the importance of using simple experimental systems to test general theoretical models of behavior. The findings further suggest that analysis of bursts could prove useful for the study and evaluation of decision-making circuitry.},

abstract = {Regulation of synaptic efficacy by nerve terminal excitability has not been extensively studied. We performed genetic and pharmacological dissections for presynaptic actions of K+ channels in Drosophila neuromuscular transmission by using electrophysiological and optical imaging techniques. Current understanding of the roles of the Shab IK channel and its mammalian Kv2 counterparts is relatively poor, as compared with that for Shaker IA channels and their Kv1 homologues. Our results revealed the striking effect of Shab mutations during high-frequency synaptic activity, as well as a functional division in synaptic regulation between the Shaker and Shab channels. Shaker channels control the basal level of release, indicated by a response to single nerve stimulation, whereas Shab channels regulate repetitive synaptic activities. These observations highlight the crucial control of nerve terminal excitability by Shaker and Shab channels to confer temporal patterns of synaptic transmission and suggest the potential participation of these channels, along with the transmitter release machinery, in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {Aggressive behavior is pervasive throughout the animal kingdom, and yet very little is known about its molecular underpinnings. To address this problem, we have developed a population-based selection procedure to increase aggression in Drosophila melanogaster. We measured changes in aggressive behavior in the selected subpopulations with a new two-male arena assay. In only ten generations of selection, the aggressive lines became markedly more aggressive than the neutral lines. After 21 generations, the fighting index increased more than 30-fold. Using microarray analysis, we identified genes with differing expression levels in the aggressive and neutral lines as candidates for this strong behavioral selection response. We tested a small set of these genes through mutant analysis and found that one significantly increased fighting frequency. These results suggest that selection for increases in aggression can be used to molecularly dissect this behavior.},

abstract = {In the mammalian brain, sleep and wakefulness are associated with widespread changes in gene expression. Sleep in fruit flies shares many features with mammalian sleep, but it is currently unknown to what extent behavioral states affect gene expression in Drosophila. To find out, we performed a comprehensive microarray analysis of gene expression in spontaneously awake, sleep-deprived and sleeping flies. Fly heads were collected at 4 am, after 8 h of spontaneous sleep or sleep deprivation, and at 4 pm, after 8 h of spontaneous wakefulness. As in rats, we found that behavioral state and time of day affect Drosophila gene expression to a comparable extent. As in rats, transcripts with higher expression in wakefulness and in sleep belong to different functional categories, and in several cases these groups overlap with those previously identified in rats. Wakefulness-related genes code for transcription factors and for proteins involved in the stress response, immune response, glutamatergic transmission, and carbohydrate metabolism. Sleep-related transcripts include the glial gene anachronism and several genes involved in lipid metabolism. Finally, the expression of many wakefulness-related and sleep-related Drosophila transcripts is also modulated by the time of day, suggesting an interaction at the molecular level between circadian and homeostatic mechanism of sleep regulation.},

Molecular genetic investigations of Drosophila learning have uncovered numerous genes whose gene products are essential for olfactory memory formation. Recent studies of the products of these genes have continued to expand the range of molecular processes known to underlie memory formation. Recent research has also broadened the neuroanatomical areas thought to mediate olfactory learning to include the antennal lobes in addition to a previously accepted and central role for the mushroom bodies. The roles for neurons extrinsic to the mushroom body neurons are becoming better defined. Finally, the genes identified to participate in Drosophila olfactory learning have conserved roles in mammalian organisms, highlighting the value of Drosophila for gene discovery.},

Here, by using Drosophila mutants with specific defects in presynaptic function, we found that glutamate receptors clustered normally at neuromuscular junctions of mutants that retained spontaneous transmitter secretion but had lost the ability to release transmitter in response to action potentials. In contrast, receptor clustering was defective in mutants in which both spontaneous and evoked vesicle exocytosis were absent. Thus, spontaneous vesicle exocytosis appears to be tightly linked to the clustering of glutamate receptors during development.},

abstract = {Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been found to be responsible for autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism characterized primarily by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons with subsequent defects in movements. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this neuron loss remain elusive. Here, we characterized Drosophila parkin loss-of-function mutants, which exhibit shrinkage of dopaminergic neurons with decreased tyrosine hydroxylase level and impaired locomotion. The behavioral defect of parkin mutant flies was partially restored by administering L-DOPA, and the dopamine level in the brains of parkin mutant flies was highly decreased. Intriguingly, we found that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is strongly activated in the dopaminergic neurons of parkin mutants and that impaired dopaminergic neuron phenotypes are dependent on the activation of the JNK signaling pathway. In consistent with this, our epistatic analysis and mammalian cell studies showed that Parkin inhibits the JNK signaling pathway in an E3 activity-dependent manner. These results suggest that loss of Parkin function up-regulates the JNK signaling pathway, which may contribute to the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila parkin mutants and perhaps autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism patients.},

abstract = {In recent years, a number of tools have become available for remotely activating neural circuits in Drosophila. Despite widespread and growing use, very little work has been done to characterize exactly how these tools affect activity in identified fly neurons. Using the GAL4-UAS system, we expressed blue light-gated Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and a mutated form of ChR2 (H134R-ChR2) in motor and sensory neurons of the Drosophila third-instar locomotor circuit. Neurons expressing H134R-ChR2 show enhanced responses to blue light pulses and less spike frequency adaptation than neurons expressing ChR2. Although H134R-ChR2 was more effective at manipulating behavior than ChR2, the behavioral consequences of firing rate adaptation were different in sensory and motor neurons. For comparison, we examined the effects of ectopic expression of the warmth-activated cation channel Drosophila TRPA1 (dTRPA1). When dTRPA1 was expressed in larval motor neurons, heat ramps from 21 to 27 degrees C evoked tonic spiking at approximately 25 degrees C that showed little adaptation over many minutes. dTRPA1 activation had stronger and longer-lasting effects on behavior than ChR2 variants. These results suggest that dTRPA1 may be particularly useful for researchers interested in activating fly neural circuits over long time scales. Overall, this work suggests that understanding the cellular effects of these genetic tools and their temporal dynamics is important for the design and interpretation of behavioral experiments.},

abstract = {Mitochondria accumulate within nerve terminals and support synaptic function, most notably through ATP production. They can also sequester Ca(2+) during nerve stimulation, but it is unknown whether this limits presynaptic Ca(2+) levels at physiological nerve firing rates. Similarly, it is unclear whether mitochondrial Ca(2+) sequestration differs between functionally different nerve terminals. We addressed these questions using a combination of synthetic and genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicators to examine cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) levels in presynaptic terminals of tonic (MN13-Ib) and phasic (MNSNb/d-Is) motor neurons in Drosophila, which, as we determined, fire during fictive locomotion at approximately 42 Hz and approximately 8 Hz, respectively. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) sequestration starts in both terminals at approximately 250 nM, exhibits a similar Ca(2+)-uptake affinity (approximately 410 nM), and does not require Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Nonetheless, mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in type Is terminals is more responsive to low-frequency nerve stimulation and this is due to higher cytosolic Ca(2+) levels. Since type Ib terminals have a higher mitochondrial density than Is terminals, it seemed possible that greater mitochondrial Ca(2+) sequestration may be responsible for the lower cytosolic Ca(2+) levels in Ib terminals. However, genetic and pharmacological manipulations of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake did not significantly alter nerve-stimulated elevations in cytosolic Ca(2+) levels in either terminal type within physiologically relevant rates of stimulation. Our findings indicate that presynaptic mitochondria have a similar affinity for Ca(2+) in functionally different nerve terminals, but do not limit cytosolic Ca(2+) levels within the range of motor neuron firing rates in situ.},

abstract = {Locomotor activity of single, freely walking flies in small tubes is analyzed in the time domain of several hours. To assess the influence of the mushroom bodies on walking activity, three independent noninvasive methods interfering with mushroom body function are applied: chemical ablation of the mushroom body precursor cells; a mutant affecting Kenyon cell differentiation (mushroom body miniature1); and the targeted expression of the catalytic subunit of tetanus toxin in subsets of Kenyon cells. All groups of flies with mushroom body defects show an elevated level of total walking activity. This increase is attributable to the slower and less complete attenuation of activity during the experiment. Walking activity in normal and mushroom body-deficient flies is clustered in active phases (bouts) and rest periods (pauses). Neither the initiation nor the internal structure, but solely the termination of bouts seems to be affected by the mushroom body defects. How this finding relates to the well-documented role of the mushroom bodies in olfactory learning and memory remains to be understood.},

abstract = {Biogenic amines play major roles in the regulation of behavior in vertebrates and invertebrates. Previous studies in honey bees and fruit-flies Drosophila suggested that octopamine (OA, invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline) and dopamine (DA) participate in appetitive olfactory conditioning with sucrose reward and aversive olfactory conditioning with electric shock punishment, respectively. In order to determine whether the effects of the two chatecholamines on electric shock and sugar learning can be generalized to other kinds of appetitive and aversive reinforcers, we studied the effects of OA and DA receptor antagonists on appetitive olfactory learning with water reward, and aversive olfactory learning with saline punishment in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. Crickets injected with epinastine or mianserin, OA receptor antagonists, into the hemolymph exhibited an impairment of appetitive learning with water reward, while aversive learning with saline punishment remained intact. In contrast, fluphenazine, chlorpromazine or spiperone, DA receptor antagonists, impaired aversive learning without affecting appetitive learning. This finding, combined with findings in previous studies, suggests that the octopaminergic reward system and dopaminergic punishment system participate in insect olfactory learning with various appetitive and aversive reinforcements.},

abstract = {The generation of coordinated body movements relies on sensory feedback from mechanosensitive proprioceptors. We have found that the proper function of NompC, a putative mechanosensitive TRP channel, is not only required for fly locomotion, but also crucial for larval crawling. Calcium imaging revealed that NompC is required for the activation of two subtypes of sensory neurons during peristaltic muscle contractions. Having isolated a full-length nompC cDNA with a protein coding sequence larger than previously predicted, we demonstrate its function by rescuing locomotion defects in nompC mutants, and further show that antibodies against the extended C terminus recognize NompC in chordotonal ciliary tips. Moreover, we show that the ankyrin repeats in NompC are required for proper localization and function of NompC in vivo and are required for association of NompC with microtubules. Taken together, our findings suggest that NompC mediates proprioception in locomotion and support its role as a mechanosensitive channel. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Jarecki1995,
abstract = {This article reveals a novel aspect in the regulation of synaptic connectivity in Drosophila. Reducing neural activity genetically or pharmacologically disrupts the normally precise embryonic and larval neuromuscular connections. In third instar larvae with mutations that affect sodium channel function or expression such as no action potential, temperature-induced paralysis E, or seizure1, foreign neuromuscular synapses, arising from inappropriate nerve sources, are observed on muscle fibers throughout the abdominal body wall. Their frequencies increase as neural activity is further reduced in double mutant combinations. These foreign connections are first observed during late embryogenesis as filopodial-like contacts, but critical period analysis suggests that neural activity must be reduced during both late embryogenesis and the first larval instar to promote the differentiation of these embryonic contacts into foreign motor synapses. In addition, the loss of electrical activity in the motoneuron, as opposed to the loss of postsynaptic potentials in the muscle fibers, appears to be responsible for these changes in connectivity. Our experiments suggest that neural activity may function during development by preventing inappropriate connections and thereby maintaining the precise connectivity achieved during nerve outgrowth and target selection.},

We demonstrate that two axons form \~{}18 boutons on muscles 7 and 6 by hatching and grow to \~{}180 boutons by third instar. We further show that, after synapse formation, the homophilic cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin II (Fas II) is localized both pre- and postsynaptically where it controls synapse stabilization. In FasII null mutants, synapse formation is normal, but boutons then retract during larval development. Synapse elimination and resulting lethality are rescued by transgenes that drive Fas II expression both pre- and postsynaptically; driving Fas II expression on either side alone is insufficient. Fas II can also control synaptic growth; various FasII alleles lead to either an increase or decrease in sprouting, depending upon the level of Fas II.},

abstract = {Until the advent of modern neuroscience, free will used to be a theological and a metaphysical concept, debated with little reference to brain function. Today, with ever increasing understanding of neurons, circuits and cognition, this concept has become outdated and any metaphysical account of free will is rightfully rejected. The consequence is not, however, that we become mindless automata responding predictably to external stimuli. On the contrary, accumulating evidence also from brains much smaller than ours points towards a general organization of brain function that incorporates flexible decision-making on the basis of complex computations negotiating internal and external processing. The adaptive value of such an organization consists of being unpredictable for competitors, prey or predators, as well as being able to explore the hidden resource deterministic automats would never find. At the same time, this organization allows all animals to respond efficiently with tried-and-tested behaviours to predictable and reliable stimuli. As has been the case so many times in the history of neuroscience, invertebrate model systems are spearheading these research efforts. This comparatively recent evidence indicates that one common ability of most if not all brains is to choose among different behavioural options even in the absence of differences in the environment and perform genuinely novel acts. Therefore, it seems a reasonable effort for any neurobiologist to join and support a rather illustrious list of scholars who are trying to wrestle the term 'free will' from its metaphysical ancestry. The goal is to arrive at a scientific concept of free will, starting from these recently discovered processes with a strong emphasis on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying them.},

abstract = {The roles of cells within the nervous system are based on their properties of excitability, which are in part governed by voltage-gated ion channels. HCN channels underlie the hyperpolarization-activated current, Ih, an important regulator of excitability and rhythmicity through control of basic membrane properties. Ih is present in multiple neuronal types and regions of the central nervous system, and changes in Ih alter cellular input-output properties and neuronal circuitry important for behavior such as learning and memory. Furthermore, the pathophysiology of neurological diseases of both the central and peripheral nervous system involves defects in excitability, rhythmicity, and signaling, and animal models of many of these disorders have implicated changes in HCN channels and Ih as critical for pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on recent research elucidating the role of HCN channels and Ih in behavior and disease. These studies have utilized knockout mice as well as animal models of disease to examine how Ih may be important in regulating learning and memory, sleep, and consciousness, as well as how misregulation of Ih may contribute to epilepsy, chronic pain, and other neurological disorders. This review will help guide future studies aimed at further understanding the function of this unique conductance in both health and disease of the mammalian brain. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Alcohol has a strong causal relationship with sexual arousal and disinhibited sexual behavior in humans; however, the physiological support for this notion is largely lacking and thus a suitable animal model to address this issue is instrumental. We investigated the effect of ethanol on sexual behavior in Drosophila. Wild-type males typically court females but not males; however, upon daily administration of ethanol, they exhibited active intermale courtship, which represents a novel type of behavioral disinhibition. The ethanol-treated males also developed behavioral sensitization, a form of plasticity associated with addiction, since their intermale courtship activity was progressively increased with additional ethanol experience. We identified three components crucial for the ethanol-induced courtship disinhibition: the transcription factor regulating male sex behavior Fruitless, the ABC guanine/tryptophan transporter White and the neuromodulator dopamine. fruitless mutant males normally display conspicuous intermale courtship; however, their courtship activity was not enhanced under ethanol. Likewise, white males showed negligible ethanol-induced intermale courtship, which was not only reinstated but also augmented by transgenic White expression. Moreover, inhibition of dopamine neurotransmission during ethanol exposure dramatically decreased ethanol-induced intermale courtship. Chronic ethanol exposure also affected a male's sexual behavior toward females: it enhanced sexual arousal but reduced sexual performance. These findings provide novel insights into the physiological effects of ethanol on sexual behavior and behavioral plasticity.},

abstract = {Synaptic vesicles fuse at active zone (AZ) membranes where Ca(2+) channels are clustered and that are typically decorated by electron-dense projections. Recently, mutants of the Drosophila melanogaster ERC/CAST family protein Bruchpilot (BRP) were shown to lack dense projections (T-bars) and to suffer from Ca(2+) channel-clustering defects. In this study, we used high resolution light microscopy, electron microscopy, and intravital imaging to analyze the function of BRP in AZ assembly. Consistent with truncated BRP variants forming shortened T-bars, we identify BRP as a direct T-bar component at the AZ center with its N terminus closer to the AZ membrane than its C terminus. In contrast, Drosophila Liprin-alpha, another AZ-organizing protein, precedes BRP during the assembly of newly forming AZs by several hours and surrounds the AZ center in few discrete punctae. BRP seems responsible for effectively clustering Ca(2+) channels beneath the T-bar density late in a protracted AZ formation process, potentially through a direct molecular interaction with intracellular Ca(2+) channel domains.},

abstract = {This publication reviews recent literature describing what researchers want with regard to data storage and access. It was commissioned by SURFfoundation. Fifteen recent sources were studied, covering the Netherlands, the UK, the USA, Australia, and Europe. The main findings of the review are that researchers can benefit from support services in managing their digital data, although these services must meet a number of requirements if they are to be successful. Although there are major differences in the way disciplines conduct their research, there are also common factors across disciplines when it comes to research data storage and access. The following factors play a role in making storage successful: Tools and services must be in tune with researchers workflows, which are often discipline-specific (and sometimes even project-specific) Researchers resist top-down and/or mandatory schemes. Researchers favour a cafeteria model in which they can pick and choose from a set of services. Tools and services must be easy to use. Researchers must be in control of what happens to their data, who has access to it, and under what conditions. Consequently, they want to be sure that whoever is dealing with their data (data centre, library, etc.) will respect their interests. Researchers expect tools and services to support their day-to-day work within the research project; long-term/public requirements must be subordinate to that interest. The benefits of the support must clearly visible not in three years time, but now. Support must be local, hands-on, and available when needed. Notably, storage and preservation are two distinct issues for researchers. Although they expressed a clear need for support in day-to-day storage, they see preservation as a different step that falls somewhat outside their immediate scope of interest. They also indicated a clear wish to be in control of who has access to their data and under what conditions. The requirements will be taken further in CARDS, a new project aimed at providing researchers at five universities in the Netherlands with efficient and effective support in managing research data. The support will be organised at a local level and adapted to the demands of the research groups. The account managers involved will share their materials and lessons learned and communicate them to other universities after the project is completed.},

abstract = {There are fundamental similarities between sleep in mammals and quiescence in the arthropod Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that sleep-like states are evolutionarily ancient. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans also has a quiescent behavioural state during a period called lethargus, which occurs before each of the four moults. Like sleep, lethargus maintains a constant temporal relationship with the expression of the C. elegans Period homologue LIN-42 (ref. 5). Here we show that quiescence associated with lethargus has the additional sleep-like properties of reversibility, reduced responsiveness and homeostasis. We identify the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) gene egl-4 as a regulator of sleep-like behaviour, and show that egl-4 functions in sensory neurons to promote the C. elegans sleep-like state. Conserved effects on sleep-like behaviour of homologous genes in C. elegans and Drosophila suggest a common genetic regulation of sleep-like states in arthropods and nematodes. Our results indicate that C. elegans is a suitable model system for the study of sleep regulation. The association of this C. elegans sleep-like state with developmental changes that occur with larval moults suggests that sleep may have evolved to allow for developmental changes.},

abstract = {Dopaminergic neurons are thought to drive learning by signaling changes in the expectations of salient events, such as rewards or punishments. Olfactory conditioning in Drosophila requires direct dopamine action on intrinsic mushroom body neurons, the likely storage sites of olfactory memories. Neither the cellular sources of the conditioning dopamine nor its precise postsynaptic targets are known. By optically controlling genetically circumscribed subsets of dopaminergic neurons in the behaving fly, we have mapped the origin of aversive reinforcement signals to the PPL1 cluster of 12 dopaminergic cells. PPL1 projections target restricted domains in the vertical lobes and heel of the mushroom body. Artificially evoked activity in a small number of identifiable cells thus suffices for programming behaviorally meaningful memories. The delineation of core reinforcement circuitry is an essential first step in dissecting the neural mechanisms that compute and represent valuations, store associations, and guide actions. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.
